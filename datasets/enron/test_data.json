Last year your support helped Enron raise $2.8 million, which was 21 percent more than our original goal.  \n\nThis year, we hope to reach our employee goal of $2.9 million.  Enron will match every employee's contribution dollar-for-dollar.  We ask that employees who gave last year consider increasing their pledge this year, and that those who did not give, consider making a modest donation.\n\nThe decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers.  We will also be focusing on our United Way Scholars program, an innovative program created this year by Enron and the United Way.  The Scholars program builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.\n\nON-LINE PLEDGING \nWe will once again utilize an on-line pledging system to streamline the pledge process that will require your HRGIS ID (shown below). Click on < or go to < to make your contribution and learn more about this year's campaign. Please make your electronic pledge no later than Friday, August 17.  \n\nDAYS OF CARING \nWe are focusing on flood relief, and on our business units, by replacing the traditional large-scale kick-off event with Days of Caring, which will take place Tuesday through Friday of this week. We invite you to join your business unit for a Day of Caring at your 2001 Adopted Agency. This year's adopted agencies were selected in part due to the amount of flood damage suffered by the agency or its clients. To sign up for Day of Caring, log on to < \n\nAPPRECIATION LUNCH\nRounding out the Days of Caring is an Appreciation Event on Friday, August 10 in Antioch Park from 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.  Come celebrate the success of Days of Caring, enjoy a free Chic-Fil-A lunch and watch a team of your coworkers compete against the other business units by creating building block structures that exemplify Enron attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  Jackie Martin, President of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, will join us in judging the structures. If you bring down the building blocks that were on your chair this morning and donate them to our 2001 Adopted Agencies, you will be entered in a drawing for two free round-trip airline tickets anywhere in the U.S.\n\nThank you for your generosity.

It outlines in detail the procedures to be followed under that \nprogram.\nIt is a program that has been designed by the I.R.S. and the U.S. relocation \ncouncil to deal with the issues of relocation and taxable benefits.\nOne thing that I want to you to remember is that if you have an offer on your \nproperty,  you must negotiate it verbally and please do not signed nor \ninitial anything on the offer.

Identify appropriate recent auction research (3\n> or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the\n> authors to post on our site\n\n> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction\n> literature (with hyperlinks?)\n\n> 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting\n> services to our customers (if they are interested)\n\nThird:\nThere is an e-procurement forum at Haas School of business,\nin May 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor Prof. Arie Segev.\nA person from Wells Fargo Bank will talk about Wells Fargo's role\nin e-marketplace payment initiative,\nwhere ENRON broadband services is also one of key players\nalong with Citibank.\nHe asked me whether you can contact a person at\nENRON broadband services, who's related to the initiative.\nHe wants to know whether we will have a speaker from ENRON\nto see ENRON's perspective, in the Forum.\n\nHere is a link to news related to the initiative,\n\n\n\nFourth:\nMy advisor wants to know whether\nthere could be any opportunity to do a case study,\nregarding ENRON's business.\nHe is interested in e-procurement and e-marketplaces.\nBusiness model and System architecture...\n\nThanks for reading this long email.\nI'll look forward to your answer..\nI am sorry for giving you so much burden\nto answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.\n\nWarm regards,\nJinbaek\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nJinbaek Kim\nPh.D Candidate\nDept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research\nU.C.Berkeley\n\n\nGo Bears!\n\n      :\"'._..---.._.'\";       `.             .'       .'           `.\n     :      a   a      :                 __....._\n     :     _.-0-._     :---'\"\"'\"-....--'\"        '.\n      :  .'   :   `.  :                          `,`.\n       `.: '--'--' :.'                             ; ;\n        : `._`-'_.'                                ;.'\n        `.

Nora, this will no doubt pose some interesting questions\nrelative to DealBench.  And, of course, if and to the extent that Enron\nwants to set up or otherwise get involved in multiple participant B2B\nInternet trading sites that involve transactions that will be completed\non-line, there will be some issues that need to be addressed.]\n\nThis should be viewed as a very preliminary report because I have not had a\nchance to study the new rules carefully.  I will send more complete\ninformation later.\n\nLast week the Commodities Futures Trading Commission adopted its \"new\nregulatory framework,\" a series of rules that I believe will greatly expand\nthe breadth, depth, height, weight and size of the CFTC's bureaucracy  and\nthe scope of the CFTC's regulatory involvement in all sorts of things\n(including financial guarantees) that it has not attempted to regulate\nheretofore.  The CFTC described this rule making as a \"regulatory\nreinvention.\" Indeed, the CFTC has reinvented itself without Congressional\nauthorization to do so.  In particular, under the new rules, for the first\ntime the CFTC's \"board of trade\" regulation is not confined to markets in\nwhich \"speculators\" participate.  In effect, it has extended its \"board of\ntrade\" regulatory reach into a portion of the over-the-counter market that\ninvolves only business participants.\n\nProbably the biggest headache for all of us will be the new rules relating\nto Clearing Organizations, defined as \"a person who provides credit\nenhancement functions\" with respect to certain transactions, including\ntransactions that rely on the new bilateral contract exemption discussed\nbelow.  In many cases it will be illegal for a company that does not\nregister with and become regulated by the CFTC as a Recognized Clearing\nOrganization (RCO) to provide credit enhancement functions.  I obviously\nneed to study the rules further, but my initial read is that the rules are a\ndisaster in drafting.  For example, I don't think that the CFTC intended to\nsay that a parent company cannot guarantee a swap entered into by its\nsubsidiary unless the parent company registers as an RCO, but on my initial\nreading it appears to me that the rule is not at all clear and could be read\nthat way.  So if you are working on any transaction that involves a\nguarantee of a swap or other transaction that is exempt under the new\nexemption for bilateral contracts, you need to run this issue to ground\nbefore you close.  The rules don't become effective, however, until 60 days\nafter they are published in the Federal Register.\n\nThere are some good things about the new rules.  The new exemption for\nbilateral contracts greatly liberalizes the swaps exemption and expands it\nso that it covers contracts other than swaps.  It provides greater certainty\nregarding the enforceability of derivatives and, in most cases, of contracts\nfor physical delivery of commodities.\n\nThe bilateral contracts exemption, however, is unavailable for contracts\nentered into through \"Multiple Transaction Execution Facilities\" or MTEFs.\nMultiple participant B2B Internet trading sites will be classified as MTEFs,\nunless participants are required to go off-line to complete the contracts\n(as, for example, CheMatch requires its participants to do). Under the new\nrules, multiple participant B2B Internet trading sites that involve swaps\nand other derivative contracts completed on-line must submit themselves to\nCFTC regulation as \"Derivatives Transaction Facilities\" or DTFs.  Moreover,\nan MTEF that trades only in physical delivery contracts can achieve contract\nenforcement certainty of the type offered by the exemption for bilateral\ncontracts only if it submits itself to regulation as a DTF.  The MTEF\ndefinition excludes any Internet trading site, such as EnronOnline, that\ninvolves a single party offering to enter into trades with multiple parties,\nand therefore the sponsor of such a site can take advantage of the exemption\nfor bilateral contracts without submitting itself to CFTC regulation.  DTFs\nmust not permit any person other than an \"eligible commercial participant\"\nto trade.  The term \"eligible commercial participant\" is defined in the rule\nand includes, generally, commercial counterparties and financial\nintermediaries.\n\n  Although the CFTC promises that its regulation of DTFs will be more\nlight handed that that historically applied to U.S. futures exchanges, the\nnew regulatory framework is likely to result in significant regulatory\noversight of multiple participant B2B Internet trading sites that register\nas DTFs.  Under the new rules, each sponsor must determine whether to\nrestrict trading on its site to avoid CFTC regulation or to submit to\nregulation.\n\n\nRobert S.

Thus, \nthe process would be as follows:\n\n1) Each legal group (NA and UK) defines the rules which are applied to \nrestrict companies for trading (e.g. Must have a Power license to trade \nPower) for its group of products\n2) Each legal group applies its own rules to all counterparties (NA and UK)\n\nIf you will send me a list of all preapproved European counterparties and \nensure that I receive copies of all new European counterparty lists, I will \nbegin implementing this process.\n\nThis proposed process is subject to feedback from Edmund and Justin.  \n\nRegards,\n\nLeslie\n\n\n\n\nDavid Forster\n12/21/99 03:48 AM\nTo: Leslie Hansen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Frank L Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECT, Edmund \nCooper/LON/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: F/U re European power trading by U.S. counterparties  \n\nThis is contrary to the mandate of EnronOnline, which is to make global \nproducts trading available to our customers.\n\nIf there is a specific reason for shutting down a company, then we must do so \n- but we cannot restrict companies from trading products simply because we \ndon't think they want to.\n\nHow about this as an alternative:\n\n1) Define the rules which are applied to restrict companies for trading (e.g. \nMust have a Power license to trade Power)\n2) Distribute the appropriate rules and company lists between the NA primary \nlegal contact and UK primary legal contact (for profile purposes)\n3) Each legal group (NA and UK) apply each others rules to the companies \nwhich they are reviewing\n4) Each legal group copies the other with the final company profile which \nthey are sending to Frank Davis.\n\n\nIn this way, profiles should be correct as they leave each legal group, but \neach group has the opportunity to scan the work of the other. If there are \nany problems, then the customer profiles can be corrected - if necessary \nafter the fact.\n\nThis exposes us to (in my opinion) a very small risk that:\n 1) The rules for one group are not correctly applied by the other or there \nare extenuating circumstances for a particular party and\n 2) The error is not caught before the customer transacts (bear in mind that \nafter legal completes their review, there is still a great deal of time \nbefore the customer can transact, on account of: profile completion process, \nmailing time, customer delay before trading)\n\nDave\n \n\n\n\n\nLeslie Hansen\n12/20/99 05:15 PM\nTo: Frank L Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Forster/LON/ECT@ECT, Bob \nShults/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Edmund Cooper/LON/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Elizabeth \nSager/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: F/U re European power trading by U.S. counterparties\n\nI have spoken with Edmund Cooper to follow up regarding access to European \npower products by U.S. counterparties.

I think the whole ordeal is harder when it is a baby....\nSo needless to say I have been out of the office way too much and I am so\nvery much behind!\n\nGood news!  I have some pictures that I will be sending to you next week!\nThat way you will not be able to forget what I look like.... I keep\nforgetting them in my truck but I will make it a priority to send them to\nyou by Tues.\n\nHow is everything going for you?  Keeping busy with work and hopefully your\nsocial life?  I think that you are the type that works way too many hours!!\nI am sure that one day you will balance everything out...\n\nWell it has been a full day ( I know it is only 3:00... ) and it is also\nFriday so I am going to call it good and go home, take a nap and get up in\na couple of hours and head down to Seattle with Julie and Angie...\n\nHave a great weekend and I will talk to you Tuesday!\n\nTake Care,\n\nDee\n\n>>> <Gerald.Nemec@enron.com> 09/20/00 11:35AM >>>\nAre you still out there?  Sent you an email last week but didn't hear from\nyou.

Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=\nr foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=\ntion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.\n\n?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=\nadged contractor at all times.\n\n?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=\nyee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=\nn area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=\nent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=\n the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=\n, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =\nescorting employee or badged contractor.\n\n?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =\nworkplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=\nrity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=\nou or hold doors open, allowing \"tail gating\" by others.\n\nThese will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=\nuted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=\n in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=\npment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=\nse measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09\n\n\nTravel Advisory Update\n\nWith the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=\ntions:\n\n?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=\ns that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=\nongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=\nistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=\nrgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =\nplanned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=\nbia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.\n\n?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=\ny recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =\nreports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=\ned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=\nsult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=\nted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=\neir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=\n that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=\n as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=\ngration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=\nity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her \"regi=\nstration\" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=\nt Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=\nsing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=\ntorically been asking domestic travelers for \"registration\" documentation, =\nbut in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=\n would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=\nurrent lawful status.\n\nWe will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=\nate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.\n\n", "folder": "corp"}, {"cleaned_text": "Hi Rick,\n\nI'm responding to your very nice voicemail message in writing because I seem to have less control over my emotions these days than I would like.

The\nsomewhat high price is because they stay at either the Four Seasons or Sutton\nPlace.\n\nThe total is $6026 or $1506 for each of us (if I did the math right--check\nit).  This price includes airfare, port charges, all food etc on board. It\ndoesn't include alcohol or sodas on board, any excursions taken in port\n(sightseeing tours), tips for cabin steward, waiter and busboy (about $200\nfor the trip). So we could also throw in a few hundred dollars of mad money.\n\nThis price ($2555.45 per person with the hotel in Vancouver) is really\ngreat--they are doing some kind of special.  Holland America is much more and\na comparable cruise with no balcony is $2440).\n\nI have a reservation for them which is good until Monday.  There is a $500\ndeposit required with the balance due 60 days before departure.\n\nLet me know what you think--comments, etc.\n\nDebbie", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "Thank you for changing lives.\n\nEmployee ID:  90009718\nName:  MICHELLE H CASH\nPayment Amount:  650.00\nPayment Method:  Deduct a portion from each paycheck\nLeadership Giving Roster:  Listed at the President\nMake a Difference Club:  Not Applicable\nMailing Address:\n4531 BEECH ST\nBELLAIRE , TX  77401\nUS\nYour donation is designated for:  SEARCH\nWritten Acknowledgement of Contribution:  NO\n\n\n\n\t\"You will find, as you look back on your life, that the moments that\nstand out are\n\tthe moments when you have done things for others.\"\n\t\t-Henry Drummond\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

There are still people missing, but \nit's a pretty good start.  I will volunteer to be the keeper of the master \nlist for a while, and will send out updates monthly or when needed to \neveryone.  If there is anyone missing from the email list or something needs \nto be changed, please send it to me.  If I should ever go back to work, I \nwill find a volunteer in the family to be the master keeper of the list.  I \ndid receive an error on Vern, Brad and Greg when sending this email.   \nHopefully someone can send me their correct email address. \n\nI put this address book together to accomplish two things.  First, I am \nwriting a family cookbook so I need to be able to communicate individually \nwith all of you.  More on that later.  Second, this should give the guys \nputting together the next reunion a little easier way to correspond with the \nfamily rather that having to mail to everyone.  This way they only have to \nmail to those not on the list. \n\nNow, for what this list is not for.  This is not for any of you to send group \nemails for jokes and cartoons, or chain letters.  Some of the people on this \nlist have given work email addresses.  They cannot receive improper emails \n(especially if you work for the ATF).  If any of you do start receiving \nunwanted emails, please let that person know immediately to stop.   If they \ndo not stop, please let me know and we will remove them from the family email \nlist.   \n\nThanks to all of you that helped me to get this information.  I am still \nworking on getting more addresses, so let me know if you have any. \n\nFor those of you that haven't heard this yet, I am trying to write a family \ncookbook.  I am hoping to get the recipes for everything our parents used to \nmake for us while we were growing up.  I also want to get three or four of \nyour own favorite recipes from each cousin.  There will be other nice tidbits \nin the cookbook about everyone, maybe a story from when you were growing up?   \nOr even something current in your life.  I will not send out mass emails very \noften.  I will be talking individually to each of you over the next couple of \nmonths.  So for any of you that just can't wait for that individual contact, \nplease send your recipes in now.  Bill Billinger is sending his this week, I \nthink? \n\nThis is exciting to me to get this address book out to all of you.

Some people have a lot of \nexperience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.  \nSome have been working in the energy industry for several years while others \nare new to the business.  We are hoping that the course will be helpful to \npeople with different backgrounds.  Each participant in the class is not only \nresponsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give \nconstructive feedback to Jon Koomey and to us on how to make the course \nbetter.

I wanted to get closer. And the price I\npaid was leaving my shoes in the middle of a pile of suffocating bodies.  At\nthe Wall St. train stop people were covered with papers.  A plane crash.\nThat's what everyone said.  Then a boom.  Everyone ran.  I ran to my office\non Wall and Pearl and called my brother in Illinois.\nI wanted to be closer.  At the corner of Church and Broadway, I angled my\nway\nthrough a large, packed crowd to get the best view.  We talked about people\njumping.  The police stood behind the yellow tape.  Minutes later, there was\na boom.  I thought it was a bomb, so I crouched, but people ran, so I ran.\nI\ncouldn't see anything.  I don't know how far I ran.  Couldn't see where I\nwas\nrunning.  Didn't know if I was in a street or next to a building. Didn't\nknow\nwhat street I was on.  No one could talk because the dust filled our\nthroats.\n  After about ten steps I tripped over a pile of people and then people\ntripped on me.\nI laid there. The only sound was the falling of dust and debris.  No one\nmoved under me.  The weight of people on top of me got heavier.  I couldn't\nbreathe. I knew we were all going to die in that pile.  I pulled myself out\nof the pile.  My slip-ons slipped off.  I stood up and saw nothing.  Not\neven\nand inch in front of me.  I put my hands out and felt for something.  I\nbumped into the brick side of a building.  I bumped into milk crates.  I\nstopped. I had no idea what to do, and I knew everyone around me was\nsuffocating.  I thought about my Mom and dad, they would be so sad to hear\nthat I died.  I thought about my husband. Just married and I will not get to\nlive my life with him.  I thought about my brothers.  They would cry.  I\ntold\nmyself to just keep trying to find away to air, but I didn't believe I would\nlive.\nI bumped into something that I could feel the top of, so I lifted myself up.\nI worried I was going into the back of a dump truck, and I was scared I'd be\ntrapped.  I didn't know if there was fire, or a bomb.  I didn't know how to\nprotect myself ??\" find air.  Go up? ??\" so I didn't know for sure that a\ndump\ntruck would be bad.  I think it was scaffolding.  I think I jumped over\npiles\nof bodies by climbing scaffolding.\nI pulled myself into a building. What building? I don't know.  And I took a\nbreath.  I took two breaths.  I was sure the building would be bombed.  I\nlooked for stairs.  I kept thinking I needed clean air.  I found a bathroom.\nI didn't realize I wanted water until it was there.  Four men inside. Two\nfighting   faucet.  I shared the toilet with another man.  We drank almost\nthe whole bowl.\nOnce the four of us were calmed by water and air, we ventured outside the\nbathroom.  We walked up stairs. S lowly.  We checked doors behind us, left\nthem all open.  We got up only one floor.  We waited.  I cried.  They shared\none can of apple juice.\nThe intercom in the building announced stay where you are.  I was so\nrelieved\nto know people knew we were there.  The intercom announced again and I\nthought another bomb would go off and I'd die.  I cried.  The guy with the\napple juice put his arm around me.  I wondered why no one else cried.  The\nintercom announced to go down the stairs.  I picked up a wastebasket: I\nplanned to fill it with water.  Planned to use it to shelter myself from the\nnext bomb.  (I still had no idea the building collapsed.)\nIn the lobby of the building someone gave me a Nantucket Nectar and told me\nto vomit.  I walked outside the building with the drink in my wastebasket.\nThere was no one around. White everywhere.  The four of us had nowhere to\ngo.\n  I couldn't remember where I was.  I walked toward the water.  Police\ndirected very one north.  I asked a woman next to me, \"Where are we going?\"\nShe said, \"I don't know.\"  She had no dust.  She looked so steady.  I\nfollowed her.  This was the beginning of her long protection.\nShe said, \"You can walk home with me.  You need a shower.\"  I coughed.  She\nasked why I was carrying a wastebasket.  I said, \"In case there's another\nbomb.\"  She held on to my arm as we made our way next to the river.  In\nChinatown, she bought me shoes.  At the Bowery we finally found a pay phone\nthat didn't have a line of people.  So she called her husband and I sat down\nnext to my wastebasket.  It was the first time I sat down, and I started\ncrying.\nWe resumed walking.  Sometimes we ran.  I made sure to keep up and I didn't\ntell Teresa that I was worried that I would faint.  I drank Nantucket Nectar\nevery time I got dizzy.\nAt 59th St. a plane went overhead and I screamed.  In front of\nBloomingdales.\n  There was no one there from Wall St. I knew I looked crazy.  I screamed\nanyway.  I reminded everyone there were no planes allowed to fly.  Someone\nsaid, \"It's the army.\"  I came out from under my wastebasket and kept\nwalking.  Theresa's apartment was 71st on the Upper West Side. Where\neveryone\nlooked fine.\nIn the shower, dripping debris down my body, I remembered one more moment\nunder the rubble.  When I couldn't breathe. When I couldn't see.  In the\nmiddle of the dead quiet was a voice.  He said, \"Is there anyone here? Can\nsomeone hold my hand?\" I reached out to the voice, and held his hand.  It\nwas\nshaking and the skin was old.  I squeezed and then I let go.\n\nBetty Sweeny\nBusiness Development Associates, Inc.\nTele: (302) 762-7340\nFax: (302) 762-7348\nEmail: <A HREF=\"easbda@aol.com\">easbda@aol.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</A>\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at ", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "Jinbaek,\n\nYou can coordinate the details with me.\nLet me know what the time frame is for you\nand we shall send you an appropriate offer.\n\nVince\n\n\n\n\n\nJinbaek Kim <jinbaek@ieor.berkeley.edu> on 03/02/2001 04:43:06 PM\nTo: Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Summer internship\n\n\nDr. Kaminski,\n\nThank you very much.\nOf course, I'll be happy to have an opportunity\nto work at such a wonderful company.\nI was contacting with Surech Raghavan at Deal Bench team,\nand was going to express my appreciation to you again\nafter settling down process with them.\n\nFor the period of working,\nI still need to coordinate with my advisor and\nmay need to adjust according to that.\nbut anyway, I'll try to coordinate smoothly.\n\nPlease let me know whether I should keep contacting\nwith Deal Bench team,\nfor working period and\nfor misc. living support such as finding a place, rent a car, etc.\n\nI appreciate you so much again,\nfor arranging such meetings and giving me an opportunity.\nAll this opportunity will not be available to me,\nwithout your kind help.\n\nWarm Regards,\nJinbaek\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nJinbaek Kim\nPh.D Candidate\nDept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research\nU.C.Berkeley\n\n\nGo Bears!\n\n      :\"'._..---.._.'\";       `.             .'       .'           `.\n     :      a   a      :                 __....._\n     :     _.-0-._     :---'\"\"'\"-....--'\"        '.\n      :  .'   :   `.  :                          `,`.\n       `.: '--'--' :.'                             ; ;\n        : `._`-'_.'                                ;.'\n        `.

WE APPRECIATE THE\nOFFER TO PAY FOR AIRFARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We had been thinking of\nrenting a van to drive the whole way.\n\nThe tricky thing again this year is figuring out how to get Ben there.  He\nhas another church event the week of June 25th-July 2nd.  We thought about\nhaving him ride back on the bus to Omaha (so he doesn't miss out on the fun\nstuff they do on the way back), arriving Monday the 2nd around noon, and\nthen we all fly out together on the afternoon of the 2nd or... Mark Anna and\nI leave on Friday or Saturday the 28th or 29th, and have Marlyss and Gary\nhelp Ben catch a flight Monday the 2nd or Tuesday the 3rd.  Mark should be\nable to take the whole week off.\n\nThe other tricky thing in the whole deal has to do with whether Ben will\nhave to take summer school.  He has been told that if he flunks a class this\nsemester, he will have to retake it in summer school.  We won't know for\nsure if he is going to flunk until the middle or end of May.  If he has to\ntake summer school, he will not go on the church event or come to Houston\nwith us because summer school is only offered the first part of June through\nJuly 13th.  If reservations are made for Ben, we would not be able to use\nit.  Let me know your thoughts.\n\nI did look up information again about the educational IRA.

It creates a sense of false \nsecurity for\nboth an employee and the company.\n\nI shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc \nyou.\nI would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.\n\nVince\n\n\n\n\n\nDale Surbey\n07/11/2000 10:23 AM\nTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Steve Leppard\n\nHi Vince,\n\nHR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a \nnoticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to \npay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with \na potential gap - particularly in light of what we're seeing in our quant \nrecruiting effort for credit trading and research.\n\nI'd like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and \nkeep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:\n\n1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  I'm not \nsure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token \nsalary increase.\n\n2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for \nmaking Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to \nEBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy \nand motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at \nyear-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater \nresponsibility.\n\n3)  We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr) \ncontract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of \nthese will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.  \nWe've not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer \nto keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually \nbinding him to the job.\n\nI'd value your thoughts on this.\n\nThanks,\n\nDale\n\n\n\n\n\n", "folder": "management"}, {"cleaned_text": "is 07876 395 634\n\nJ", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "Below is the scheduled of the performers for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

I have \noutlived my welcome.  It appears that you have gotten everything you've ever \nwanted and now are discarding me and our relationship.  The horrible thing is \nthat I'm not sure how long this has been going on.  It seems that every time \nwe have problems, I buy you something new and our relationship miraculously \nheals itself.  I now believe (and have probably always believed) that if I \nwouldn't have decided to build the house, you'd have already left me.  That's \na shame, because I will never forgive you for allowing me to sell MY home \n(and the girls home) and then discarding our marriage sending me and my \nfamily out into the streets without the most important material thing \nJennifer and Lindsay have ever had.\n\nI look back at our 9 years of marriage, especially the last five years and \nthe only time I can remember truly being loved and appreciated was when you \nwere pregnant with Natalie.  You blame me for not being as good to you as I \nwas when you were pregnant, but I say that you were the one who changed after \nyou had Natalie.  Not that you weren't that way before you were pregnant, you \nwere just different during the pregnancy.\n\nI''ve played this game much too long.  I need to be loved, appreciated and \nrespected.  I'm neither of those.  I deserve better and maybe, since you are \nobviously so unhappy, you do too.\n\nI'm positive the effect on Natalie will be devastating.  That's why we have \ndecided to drag this out this long.  But our relationship, if you can call it \nthat, has degraded to a very low and dangerous point.  That's why I have \ndecided to move into an apartment after the girls go home.  I have already \nbeen looking, I just need to decide where to move.\n\nAs for custody, I'm sure we will have differing opinions and we will have to \ndiscuss them in person.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could make some time over the next couple days \nto discuss with me the timing of my move and discuss how we are going to \nhandle it with our parents, friends and mostly the kids.\n\n\nBitterly,\n\nBill Scholtes", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "Hi honey please print this too.

In \naddition, software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on \na continual basis, and to store the entirety of open positions on EOL in a \ndynamic matrix facilitating analysis. IT has yet to get back with me on how \nthe software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit \npurposes.\n\nThese data files are stored in a format for reading by Excel or by SAS, for \nwhich I have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines \nelucidating the structure of the data.\n\nI am in the process of documenting all of this for you.\n\nWith regards the Gas Model and its slow performance on the Compaq, Dell has \nagreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the Compaq, to see if \nthe performance issue of the LP is related to the Compaq. I have been \nresearching this issue with IT here and with Compaq and Dell. The new machine \nwill be here any day now (no financial obligation to anyone), and I will be \nable to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is \nCompaq-specific.\n\nI am also in the process of documenting the Gas Model for you.\n\nI've tried to do my best for you, Vasant, but I have been frustrated by not \nonly the death of my mother but some internal systems in IT here. Just the \nother day, SAS could not open a full query of the EOL database because there \nwasn't enough free space on the server's hard drive for the workfiles. In \ndiscussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power \ntrading, people whom I have known for over 10 years, they indicated they were \nubiquitous here. The power traders have similar PC's to my new one, and they \nhave complained from Day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones.  Also, \nthere remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses; \nduring my brief tenure here IT has gone through two differing proposals as to \nhow to address this. When I have been told of tools available for real-time \ndata harvesting, my requests for such have typically been met with \"well, we \nhave it, but we haven't really tested it yet.\" An example is the weather: we \nstill do not record to disk the hourly NWS observations from the GOES \nsatellite.\n\nMy interests here are to help Enron to do well, because I will do well only \nif Enron does well. These aren't empty words- my IRA is 100% invested in the \nEnron stock fund. I believe my best contributions to Enron will be in the \nareas of systems as well as modeling, and the difficulty working in the \nResearch Group, in terms of systems development, is that, frankly, few people \nat Enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems. We aren't \ndirectly generating revenues for Enron, and we aren't really their customers, \nexcept in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses.\n\nAs it happens, Power Trading posted an opening for a Modeling and Forecasting \nperson, and I spoke with them and they asked me to take the job, reporting to \nGeorge Hopley. It is a wonderful opportunity for me, Vasant, as they are \ninterested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their \ntraders' access to real-time fundamentals data. I was completely candid with \nKevin Presto regarding my shortcomings here in Research- I told him you were \ndisgusted with me because I repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines. They \nalso understand I have yet to be at Enron for 1 year, and thus may only bid \non a job with your permission. We agree the move is good for Enron; we all \nwork for Enron, and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but \nmerely permit it. They are comfortable with me- they have known me for years \nas a hard worker, honest and unpretensive. They have already ordered a \nstate-of-the-art Unix workstation and server for me, and they have told me \nthey will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful, \nincluding hiring an Analyst to work for me. And, I have already been able to \nteach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis I \nhave learned here.\n\nSo, I am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening. It would be \na lateral move in position and salary, and I would commit to you to help you \nin any way possible in the future with regards the Gas Model or the EOL \ndatabase. I will continue to work on their improvement, and complete their \ndocumentation.\n\nAs it happens, I am away on Enron business in Portland Monday and Tuesday, \nand will be back Wednesday. I had wanted to talk face-to-face instead of by \nemail, but Enron business supercedes- I am on a team designing the data \nwarehouse for floor trader support.\n\nClayton.\n\n", "folder": "management"}, {"cleaned_text": "There are many different variations of the \"ILOVEYOU\" computer virus still \nbeing reported.

The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  \n\n?\tAfter November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.\n\n?\tThe Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.

I ended up staying at her place my first night in Turkey, she was going to give me a ride to my hotel but did not want to venture into the area in which the hotel was booked (don't trust everything you read on the internet!).  The plane got in very late, and I had not slept at all and was very tired.  A nice muslim priest decided to serenade me at 4:30 am from the mosque just down the hill, and my attempt at sleep ended.  Turns out muslims must pray five times a day, and the mosques blare out prayers to ensure that you don't forget.\n \n  We had breakfast on the bosphorus the following morning, where I was able to learn a little bit about the traffic laws in Turkey.  We were eating across the street from a police station on a one way road, yet that didn't stop anyone from driving the wrong way down the one way!  They drive like maniacs here, and are encouraged as far as I can tell.  The traffic lights in the towns actually have a countdown timer on them, and the light goes from red to yellow to green, just like at a racetrack!  Go figure!\n \nI got on a bus to head south, and learned several things about Turkish culture and myself!  First, very few turkish speak english (I had kinda assumed that they all spoke english after taking to an english teacher on the plane), secondly, I cant speak Turkish!  After a while, I managed to write down where I wanted to go and found someone to point me in the proper direction.  The buses here are awesome, they give you coffee and tea, cookies and some lemon smelling stuff to put on your hands.  Partway through the trip some army guys got on the bus, and a guy with a big machine gun came and sat down beside me.  He stunk but I was not about to tell him so!!\n \n I spent my first day touring the battlefields of Galipolli, with several Australians and New Zealanders.  The tourguide was awesome, and the site was really neat (although very few Canadians fought there).  I got back on a bus that evening and traveled to a town down south.  I met some New Yorkers on the bus, and they made me question my decision to go to school ?n the US.  One of the girls had no clue where Calgary was, until I explained to here that it was just north of Montana, it was the typical 'Speak American Please!'\n \nOn Saturday I toured the ancient ruins at Pergamum, which are located above the town of Bergama on top of a huge hill.  I decided after touring that I would walk back to town (about 5k),  wearing my big backpack ?n 35C heat!  After walking all the way down the hill, I got to the barbwire topped fence surrounding the ruins, I felt like an idiot but there was no way I was climbing back up the hill!  There were several young local guys running down the road, and I asked them for help.  There only suggestion was to jump the fence (explained by hand signals because they spoke little english),  and I figured it was worth a try!  I managed to get over the barbwire with my backpack and only cut up my knee a little bit.  They walked back to the village with me, and wanted me to pay for them to go to the other historical sites (I think?).  I took off faster than having being chased by an angry old man after snowballing cars, and hopped! on the next bus out of town.\n \nSunday I toured the ruins of Ephesus, which were really neat, and saw an old roman theater that Elton John had played in April.  Sunday I went up to the travertines at Pamukale, one of the seven wonders of the Ancient World.  The hillside is covered with calcium deposits, and there is water running down which collects in these pools where you were once allowed to swim (no longer because they were being destroyed).  Today I am sitting in a port town called Bodrum, and have just finished touring a ancient castle, and am heading to the mausoleum (another of the seven wonders!).  Following this, I am going to go to Marmaris and get on a sailboat tomorrow for a four day trip around many small islands in the Mediterranean Sea.\n \nHope all is well in Calgary, and will keep you all up to date through my journeys!\n \nJeff\n \n \n\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at  .", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "Someone sent this to Micah the other day and he read the whole thing to me.\nIt made me want to throw-up!!!!

He is genuinely interested and curious about option\npricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually\nfigures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.\n\nThis is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talented\nthemselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you\nand/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you\nrecommend that he do to get his foot in the door?\n\nHis intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would\npreclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.

Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=\n=20\nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=\n =20\nPlease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=\n=20\nand our position on California energy issues.\n\nWhat happened in California\n\nThe source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=\nly=20\nand demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=\neased=20\nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20\nrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=\n=20\ndemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=\nt,=20\npredictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20\npercent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.\n\nIn addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=\n=20\nfactors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=\n=20\nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=\n=20\npower is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=\n=20\nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=\nng=20\nterm, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=\nn=20\nCalifornia, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20\nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=\ne=20\nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20\nwhile the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=\nt=20\nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.\n\nSecond, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=\ned=20\nin effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20\ncompetition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=\nle=20\nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20\nregulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.\n\nIn short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=\nion. =20\nRegulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=\n=20\ngeneration from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=\n=20\nspot prices.\n\nAt the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=\n=20\nthe state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=\nhich,=20\nif adopted, would have averted the current crisis.\n\nEnron=01,s Role\n\nMany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=\nix=20\nthe problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20\npoliticians and the media.  Here are the facts:\n\n? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=\n=20\nstate of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=\n=20\nsame market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20\nmarket maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=\ne=20\ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=\nts=20\nfor our customers.\n? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=\n=20\nthe problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=\n=20\nprotected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.\n\nYou may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20\npower directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=\n=20\nthe open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=\n of our=20\ncustomers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:\n\n? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20\nmarket, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=\nly=20\nfrom the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20\nallowing EES to access lower utility rates.\n? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =\nto=20\nreceive the financial benefits of their contract prices.\n? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=\n=20\nwith other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20\nreducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.\n\nEnron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=\n=20\ncrisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20\ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=\n=20\npower markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=\ners=20\nwith solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=\n=20\ndemand for our products and services.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=\n, the=20\nstate must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=\net=20\nand shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.\n\nIncreasing Supply\n\nCalifornia=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=\n=20\nshort of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=\ns=20\nthan a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=\ny=20\nmust streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20\ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=\n=20\nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20\ndisplacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=\n=20\nhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20\nfacilities.\n\nReducing Demand\n\nCustomers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =\n=20\nThey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=\n=20\nmarket would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=\nd=20\nat lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=\n.\n\nReducing Reliance on the Spot Market\n\nIn a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20\nvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=\n=20\nterm, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=\nds=20\nof the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=\n. =20\nOpening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=\nir=20\nprice risk.\n\nRestoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions\n\nThe utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20\ngreater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=\n=20\narrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=\ner=20\ntheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=\n=20\ndistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=\n=20\nneeded.\n\nJust as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=\n,=20\nwhile politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=\n=20\nworse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=\ned;=20\nand they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=\n,=20\nwhich then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20\nineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =\nit=20\nis better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=\ney=20\nor Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20\nshortage worse.\n\nThe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20\nCalifornia.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=\n=20\nthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20\nconstructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=\n=20\nCalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20\ngeneration -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=\ns=20\nand other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.\n\nAs you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=\nhe=20\ncrisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=\n will=20\ncontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20\nsolutions to the state.

These change=\ns=20\nare intended to accomplish four key objectives:\n\nFirst, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=\nl=20\nbusiness model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =\n=20\nThis model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20\naround a relatively small strategic asset position.\n\nSecond, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20\nrelationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=\n=20\ndirectly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=\n=20\nhas become increasingly difficult.\n\nThird, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=\ng=20\nthe ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20\nhindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=\ng=20\nasset positions.\n\nAnd fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=\n=20\nredeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.\n\nENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES\n\nToday, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=\n=20\nour global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20\nbusinesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20\ncoordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=\n=20\nhigher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20\nopportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=\nf=20\nEnron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=\nd=20\nmarkets.\n\nEnron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=\n=20\n(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20\noperations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=\nnit=20\nas well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.

Greg Whalley,=20\ncurrently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=\n=20\nof the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.\n\nProviding further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=\n=20\ninternational business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=\np=20\npositions:\n\nRebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=\n=20\nand CEO of Enron Global Assets.

Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=\n=20\nwill be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20\nreport to the EWS Office of the Chairman.\n\nSanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=\nhe=20\nMiddle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=\n=20\nbroadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=\n=20\nwill report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =\nof=20\nthe Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=\n=20\nEnron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=\nness=20\ninto Enron Global Assets in the near future.\n=20\nDiomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=\n=20\nEBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=\nll=20\nfocus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20\nattention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=\n=20\nthe EBS Office of the Chairman.\n\nJim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=\nS=20\nto lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=\nder=20\nto ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20\nfacilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=\n=20\nat least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=\nh=20\nAmerica.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=\n=20\nthe Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20\ntransition, Jim will join EES.\n\nIn addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20\nactivities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=\n=20\nbusinesses and the commercial support functions:\n\nEnron Net Works\nLouise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=\n and=20\nCEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20\n\nEnron Americas\nConcurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=\n=20\noperating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20\nmarketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=\nt=20\ninto a new entity, Enron Americas.

We are creating no incremental overhead in=\n=20\nthe creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=\n=20\nefficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.\n\nTo this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=\n=20\nEWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.

This alignment creates a coordinat=\ned=20\nservices organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20\nwholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=\n=20\nservices.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=\n=20\ncontinue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=\n=20\nfor specific commodities and/or geographic locations.\nLegal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.\nRegulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =\non a=20\nregional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=\n=20\nthe Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=\n=20\nEuropean and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=\nue=20\nto support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=\n=20\nand will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=\nef=20\nof Staff.\nPublic Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=\nal=20\nbasis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20\nEnron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=\n=20\nin her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=\nr=20\nwill have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=\n=20\nwell as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=\n =20\nThese individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=\n=20\nto Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.\nBusiness Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=\nver=20\nEWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.\n\nAttached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20\nServices which summarizes the changes described here.

Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.\n\nMany CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.

Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.\n\nI know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.

He is genuinely interested and curious about option\npricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually\nfigures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.\n\nThis is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talented\nthemselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you\nand/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you\nrecommend that he do to get his foot in the door?\n\nHis intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would\npreclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.

I wondered why math majors were \nnot mentioned, and was told that there was not a business need for math \nmajors.  Like liberal arts majors, they said math majors were only considered \non a person by person basis.  In my opinion, math majors have many of the \nsame skills as finance majors, and can easily adjust to accounting rotations \nas well (I did last summer, and finance majors in the program are forced to \nevery year.)  I think that Enron is missing out on many qualified candidates \nby limiting their recruitment effort.  \n\nAt Texas A&M the Career Center asks companies for a list of majors they are \ntargeting, and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the \ncareer center.  I sent my resume to Enron and asked to be included in the \ninterview process on campus.  However, many other math majors had not heard \nof Enron or the other companies, and assumed that there was no place for a \nmath major at a company like Enron.  Many math majors want to continue their \neducation, become teachers,  or work for an actuarial firm.  However, many \nare undecided.  We are constantly told of the many business possibilities \navailable to math majors by our teachers and staff, but many undergraduates \nare still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business \nenvironment.  By not mentioning math majors to the career center (a very \nsimple and inexpensive step), Enron is losing out on a very talented pool of \npeople.  While it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about Enron \nalready, had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math \nmajors would fit perfectly, and went the extra step to send Enron their \nresume outside the career center system, there are many qualified students \nwho do not do this, and opt for other companies who DID mention math majors.\n\nI called a manager in the A&A program to suggest that we consider at least \nmentioning math majors to the career centers.  I realize that it may cost \nmore to actively pursue them, talk to teachers, and attend math society \nevents.  However, I told her that including them at the career center would \nbe very inexpensive for Enron.  She reiterated that they saw no business need \nfor math majors, and that if more upper level people began requesting them, \nit would be considered.  I searched for \"mathematics\" on the Enron job \nwebsite, and had a surprising number of results.  I know that your group \ncould use math majors as well.  However, this still may be too small a number \nto merit a focus from the A&A recruiting department.  I just wanted to bring \nit to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed.\n\nThanks,\nHeather Johnson\nx53240\n", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "BammelYoungFamilies\n\n--------------------------- ListBot Sponsor --------------------------\nGet a low APR NextCard Visa in 30 seconds!\n     1.

First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  \no If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. \n\n\n?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  \n\n?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  \n\n?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.\n\nFor Counseling Assistance\n?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. \n\n?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.\n\nThis is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.

Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.\n\n1.\tPeople (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):\n---\ttalented\n---\tcreative\n---     learn from one another\n2.\tCulture and reputation:\n---\tinnovative spirit\n---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks\n---   ability to embrace change\n---   involvement in community\n3.\tWork environment:\n---\tpay and benefits\n---   true meritocracy\n---   unlimited opportunities\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.\n\nNow, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.\n\nSTOCK PRICE\n\nWe are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:\n---\tA decline in the overall market and economy;\n---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;\n---   A \"meltdown\" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;\n---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and\n---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.\n\nThese concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.\n\n---\tOver the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.\n---\tWe have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.\nWe also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:\n---\tMark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.\n--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.\n\nTHE PRC\n\nThe relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.\n\nTherefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:\n---\tEffective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.\n---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.\n---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.\n---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.\n\nIn the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.\n\nEMPLOYEE MORALE\n\nWe believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.\n---\tWe are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.\nOver the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.\n---\tWe will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.\n---\tAdditionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.\n\nEXTERNAL REPUTATION\n\nWe all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:\n---\tWe will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.\n--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.\n\nINTEGRITY & RESPECT\n\nI believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.\n---\tEnron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.\n---\tWe will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.\n---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.\n\nFinally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.", "folder": "corp"}, {"cleaned_text": "You need AUDIO for this one!!!!\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n\n\n - Duckjob.wav", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "Aimee, \nPlease let us know as soon as possible.

However, I am open most\nof the day on 12/6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end,\nplease let me know.\n\n Thanks again.

This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. \n \nUnderstanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14\nThis course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.\n\nUnderstanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19\nThis course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.\n\nStructuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20\nThis course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.

She's acting a lot more like her old self now. A lot nicer to me.  I guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of Tiger Dolls was what was wrong with her.

My apologies in \nadvance if I am covering well trodden ground. \n\nIt is settled that a counterparty will enter into one Password Agreement and \none ETA. There will be a principal Enron contracting party for the PA and \nETA, which I will refer to as the  \"Enron Principal\" . However the definition \nof \"Enron\"in both documents also includes other Enron affiliates. In this way \nthe Enron Principal enters into the PA and the ETA as an agent for any \naffiliate that may at some stage enter into an EnronOnline Transaction with \nthat counterparty. This means the relevant Enron affiliate could enforce the \nterms of the PA and ETA . This is in addition to the rights of the Enron \nPrincipal to enforce the ETA and PA. But what happens if the Enron affiliate \nis not in existence (i.e. has not been incorporated)  at the time the PA is \nsigned and the ETA is  accepted by the counterparty? It is settled law in \nAustralia and I believe in England that you cannot be a party to a contract \nif you don't exist.  \n\nWhat does this mean? Well in most instances not much. If it was a question  \nof enforcement of the contractual terms of the ETA or the PA the Enron \nPrincipal could seek the relevant remedy such as an injunction or specific \nperformance. But procedural problems in litigation could arise if a newly \nincorporated Enron company suffered damage through a breach by a counterparty \nof the ETA. For example a breach of the indemnity in clause 4. The Enron \nPrincipal could not sue for damages as it would have suffered none. \n\nWhilst not a major issue it may be prudent to ensure EnronOnline procedures \nrecognise the particular circumstances that arise when introducing a newly \nincorporated Enron entities as contracting parties through EnronOnline.

Now comes the part you need to think  about.\n \nI think we all agree that it's important for us to  get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far  into the spring semester, but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult  for us to get away without kids, etc.  So, Brad came up with a potential  alternative for how we can get together on that weekend, and then you can let me  know which you prefer.\n \nThe first option would be to have a  retreat similar to what we've done the past several years.  This year  we could go to the Heartland Country Inn (www.heartlandcountryinn.com )  outside of Brenham.  It's a nice place, where we'd have a 13-bedroom  and a 5-bedroom house side by side.  It's in the country, real relaxing,  but also close to Brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from  here.  We can golf, shop in the antique and craft stores in Brenham, eat  dinner together at the ranch, and spend time with each other.  We'd meet on  Saturday, and then return on Sunday morning, just like what we've done in the  past.\n \nThe second option would be to stay here in  Houston, have dinner together at a nice restaurant, and then have dessert  and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that Saturday  evening.  This might be easier, but the trade off would be that we wouldn't  have as much time together.  I'll let you decide.\n \nEmail me back with what would be your preference,  and of course if you're available on that weekend.  The democratic process  will prevail--majority vote will rule!  Let me hear from you as soon as  possible, preferably by the end of the weekend.  And if the vote doesn't go  your way, no complaining allowed (like I tend to do!)\n \nHave a great weekend, great golf, great fishing,  great shopping, or whatever makes you happy!\n \nBobby\n \n \n ", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "Darren,\nWe are not able to find out July deal for TGLO in the system.\nCan you look to see if you have a deal number for this month?\nThank you\nJoy", "folder": "logistics"}, {"cleaned_text": "Scherlyn,  Per our conversation here is the  meter 986296, and the months of \nFeb and March this meter needs to go to the 012-41500-02-015 contract.   \nThank you Sherlyn.  let me know and I'll enter the new track Id's.

With that said, I am listing some of the current \nissues that I have seen, that will need to be addressed quickly.  Most of \nthese issues are none of my business, but since I see unpathed gas I thought \nyou two might want to dicsuss these issues.\n\nEnron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we \nstopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get \nthis assigned?  I can find old\n   notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let \nme know.\n\nLavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for \nENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1.\n\nMidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and \nDec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with \ntransport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it \nstands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I \nthought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.\n\nChannel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:\n\n 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left \nunpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed \nappropriately.  Someone\n  needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, \nthat were nominated for January.\n\n 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This \nissue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot \nallocate was is\n  not pathed and nominated.  \n\n 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point \nspecific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 \n10,000).  This is a pathed    pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the \nrate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this \ntransaction, we are not legally covered.    Carlos was handling this pipe in \nDec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan?\n\nHPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December \nand January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back \nnext week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return.\n\n\n\nPat  -   The following  was my recollection of the assignments for Dec 1 to \nthe present.  You might want to confirm with Mary Smith and then you can \nproceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned \nissues.\n\nHank Eisenhours duties were split :\n\nMandey -   Handle all long term HPLC expense issues:  undeveloped contracts, \nDecember flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues.\n\nCarlos  -  All offsystem transactions for ENA and HPLC in Unify and all \noffsystem paper and electronic noms on Intrastate Pipes.  Ami and Stacey\n  also handle some.  There is a lot of confusion here.  I found unpathed gas \nfor December.  We'll need to address this one quickly.\n\nHPL Transports were all split by zone.  Each Logistics rep is responsible for \npathing all meters in their assigned zones in Unify.\n\nHPL Operational seems to be left unassigned. \n\nI think most of the desk assumed that Carlos took over Hanks \nresponsibilities.

Mayer\n\nIf you?ve ever wanted to change the order in which your cursor moves from\nfield to field when you press the Tab or Enter keys, this tip is for you.\nWhat you?ll want to do is change the Tab Stops or the Group Stops.\n\nThis is how you do it:\n1. Select Design Layouts from the ACT! Tools menu.\n2.  Select Edit, Field Entry Order, Show from the menu bar to display\n the Tab and Group Stops within the layout.\n\n Within each field on the layout two little gray boxes appear at the\n field's right-hand edge. The Tab Stop box has a number that\n designates its position in the Tab Stop sequence. If a field is set\n as a Group Stop, a red dot appears in the gray box just to the left\n of the numbered Tab Stop.\n\n3.  Click the number on the fields whose tab order you want to change,\n and the number disappears.\n\n ACT!Tip: If you double-click either the Tab Stop number or the\n Group Stop sign, the Object Properties dialog box appears. Click\n Cancel to make it go away.\n\n4.  Click the fields in the new order in which you want the cursor to\n move when you press the Tab key.

Fanatic User Stories\n\nThanks to so many of you for sharing how ACT! helps you run your day and\nyour business.  Here are a few stories from ACT! Fanatics that will give\nyou ideas to help make ACT! work even better for you.\n\nWhy I'm an ACT! Fanatic from Alex K.\n\n?We have been a faithful ACT! user since 1997. We have been able to\ncustomize our ACT! user fields to meet our very specific business needs. We\nare able to organize all of our customers by group and easily create\nspecialized mailings targeting any group we have created. We also use the\nscheduling feature in a network situation, so all of us are able to\nschedule service calls from any one of the network stations. As a database\nmanager, ACT! is second to none and without a doubt has made our business\nmore profitable and easier to operate.?\n\nWhy I'm an ACT! Fanatic from Robert F.\n\n?Among other things, I use ACT! for sending out faxes and e-mails to\npromote concerts for the choir I am in.  Because ACT! integrates with\nWinFax Pro and Word, I can create a template for the notice in Word, sort\nout which media contacts I want to send the notice to in ACT!, merge the\ntwo and have the notices sent automatically with WinFax Pro.  After the\nfaxes are sent, I have a report detailing the job including which faxes\nwere not received.  Integrating ACT! templates with Word really simplifies\na lot of my work and saves me a lot of time.\n\nWhy I'm an ACT! Fanatic from Dennis K.\n\nACT 2000! is my ONE STOP--it's the place where I access my database, keep\nmy calendar in order, handle my e-mail and faxes, track my sales efforts\n... and NOW, thanks to these cool \"add-ons,\"  I can effectively download\ndata quickly via egrabber and listgrabber, send e-mails in HTML form, and,\ntransfer info to my Palm Pilot.?\n\nIf you?d like to tell us why you?re an ACT! Fanatic, please visit:\n\n\n\n***********************************\nNew ACT!

Which door would you choose?\" The struggle for most\nlies in the desire to follow God completely and the fear of what\nmight be behind the door of full surrender. Most of us desire to\nfollow God, but few of us will do it at any cost. We do not\nreally believe that God loves us to the degree that we are\nwilling to give Him complete permission to do as He wills in us.\n\nIf we desire to fully walk with Christ, there is a cost. We may\ngive intellectual assent and go along with His principles and do\nfine; however, if we are fully given over to Him and His will for\nour life, it will be a life that will have adversity. The Bible\nis clear that humans do not achieve greatness without having\ntheir sinful will broken. This process is designed to create a\nnature change in each of us, not just a habit change. The Bible\ncalls it circumcision. Circumcision is painful, bloody, and\npersonal.\n\nIf God has plans to greatly use you in the lives of others, you\ncan expect your trials to be even greater than those of others.\nWhy? Because, like Joseph who went through greater trials than\nmost patriarchs, your calling may have such responsibility that\nGod cannot afford to entrust it to you without ensuring your\ncomplete faithfulness to the call. He has much invested in you on\nbehalf of others. He may want to speak through your life to a\ngreater degree than through another. The events of your life\nwould become the frame for the message He wants to speak through\nyou.\n\nDo not fear the path that God may lead you on. Embrace it. For\nGod may bring you down a path in your life to ensure the reward\nof your inheritance. \"For our light and momentary troubles are\nachieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all\" (2\nCor. 4:17).\n\n\n\n\n-----------\nThis daily devotional is published and distributed by\nCrosswalk.com.

I could not use us all of my available vacation this year \nbecause of the following reasons:\n\n1. As you know, I have been supporting three business units (EES, EPG & Enron \nIndia) this year. All these units had difficult and relatively long projects \nthat required experience in energy markets, derivatives pricing and business \nknowledge that I had gained over the last few years at Enron.\n\n2. There has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me. I \nnow have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year. \nOf the current six members, five joined us only this year and most of them \ndidn't have any prior work experience, thus requiring a lot of my time in \nrecruiting, training and mentoring.\n\n3. Given that I had to visit our Bombay office in January, 2000 for a \nbusiness trip (10 days) and will need to go there again in January, 2001, I \ncould not take leave from my work for the other two units (EES & EPG) for an \nextended period of time.\n\nSo, in summary, this year has been a long and challenging one, and as a \nresult, I could not take vacation for more than a few days. I request you to \ngrant the rollover of my remaining vacation to next year. \n\nCurrently I have 136 hours of vacation available and , of these, I expect to \nhave 112 hours unused at the end of this year.\n\nThank you,\nKrishna.\n\n\n\n", "folder": "management"}, {"cleaned_text": "Enron Global Markets ended the year with a great deal of momentum and with=\n=20\nvery high expectations for 2001.

Of particular interest to Enron may be the use of NumeriX Tools for supporting energy derivatives. \n \nThe energy solution provided is a versatile Excel/C/C++ environment for structuring and pricing complex derivatives in the electricity marketplace. The model is based on a microeconomic determination of one or multiple electricity forward curves. Power demands by utility companies are balanced with power generating plants' production to determine the marginal price of electricity for multiple geographic regions. Inter-regional transmission constraints are imposed to calculate monthly forward prices for border stations. \n \nThe energy solution is based on Monte Carlo simulation. The regional power demands and fossil fuel prices are modeled as random processes where model parameters are determined from historical data. Marginal prices from different regions are used to determine border prices. This procedure is iterated over many scenarios and subsequent averages are taken to determine the forward COB prices.\n \nI. Overview\nNumeriX is a leading provider of modular analytical toolkits and off-the-shelf applications that are used for structuring, pricing and quantifying the risk of any type of complex financial instrument or exotic derivative. NumeriX solutions are designed for easy integration with existing in-house or third-party trading or risk management applications.

To achieve Enron's vision, we need to recruit, select, retain, and manage the most talented people effectively.  We expect all employees to demonstrate Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence in the workplace.  Our efforts to achieve equal employment, and prevent harassment for all employees will guide us towards ensuring that each employee and organization is as productive, inventive, and competitive as possible in a world of changes.\n\nEnron is an equal employment opportunity (EEO) employer.  In choosing to do business with federal, state, and city government agencies, Enron implements affirmative action plans (AAP) to recruit, retain, and promote women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and covered veterans.  Our efforts are inclusive and based on sound business practices, individual qualifications and merit.  Employee and management conduct is expected to be inclusive and equitable in all aspects of the workplace, including recruitment, applicant screening, hiring, training, assignments, compensation, benefits, job performance evaluation, disciplinary action, separation, and the like.  There is no place at Enron for management practices that include bias, favoritism, discrimination, harassment, or conduct that otherwise violates the law or Company policy.\n\nEnron's Harassment Prevention Policy was developed to prevent harassment and help all employees to maintain a productive and mutually rewarding work relationship.  Harassment of any type, including sexual harassment, is contrary to our policy and preventable with education and respectful personal behavior.  We want all employees to know what harassment is, how to prevent it and how to report it.  Our policy outlines these unacceptable behaviors and helps employees better understand work-related expectations and steps.  Every employee at Enron is expected to prevent harassment and report it if it happens.  \n\nEnron's Fair Treatment Policy was developed to provide and maintain a work environment in which all employees are treated equitably.  Our goal is to resolve employment disputes promptly, informally and (where possible) at the lowest level.  Employees who believe they are treated unfairly are encouraged to discuss the matter with their immediate supervisor.  When a concern of unfair, unlawful or unsafe treatment is raised, it will be investigated thoroughly and promptly.  An effective resolution will be reached based on all the information.  The Company will take reasonable steps to ensure confidentiality, but must act on assertions indicating that a violation of policy or law has occurred.\n\nEach of these policies is available for review at   Please familiarize yourself with these policies.  Enron expects and encourages every worker to report workplace issues of concern.  If you need to speak with anyone someone regarding these policies or if an incident occurs that concerns you, please talk with your supervisor, contact your Human Resources representative, or call Enron's Office of Labor and Employment Relations Department at 713-853-7573.  Management is expected to ensure retaliation does not occur.  In addition, Cindy Olson, as  is Enron's EEO officer.  As and  Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Community Relations, Cindy has the responsibility, authority, and full support of Enron to ensure that all employees can avail themselves of our policies.\n\nYour support of respectful workplace relationships adds to a productive and rewarding work environment.

The whole team was very relieved to have a day off after 29\ndays straight of working 10-14 hour days.\n\nDay 1\nThey called the liberty call at 10 AM, which is earlier then they have ever\ncalled it. I was caught in the shower so I had to rush to finish up.  My\nbags had been packed for days so I was able to catch up with the rest of the\nteam in the Hanger Bay.  They have a new system called a Smart Card system\nthat logs everyone in and out of the ship. This always causes a 10-15 minute\ndelay.  After this though there are always plenty of boats to take us pier\nside.  We hopped on one and rode the 4 miles into the dock area.  It was a\nheavily industrious harbor and the water, though warm, looked a bit\npolluted.  Tons of jellyfish were also seen throughout the water.  We then\nwalked about a half-mile down the pier and into the American Naval Base that\nwas there.  The gates and barricades to this place were heavier then the\nWhite House and more heavily defended.  For most of the ship, they were not\ngranted overnight liberty and so the base would the focus of there\nrelaxation. There were bars setup and all sorts of activities planned.  We\ncaught a cab to our hotel, the Le Meridien that was the nicest in Bahrain\nand had its own private beach.  The hotel was like an oasis in the desert\nbecause it was outside the main city of Manama and surrounded by scrub\ndesert.  At the gate of the hotel an armed guard with a machine gun searched\nthe trunk of the cab.  Inside the hotel there were all Saudi's. It was the\nend of the Hajj, their most religious time of the year, and they all come to\nBahrain to drink, smoke, and do other sins against Allah.  The whole ship\nwas told explicitly to stay out of their way by the XO of the ship.  Our\nrooms weren't ready so we dumped our bags and went out to the pool caf, for\nsome lunch.  Lunch was a huge buffet spread that had shwarma's, Persian\nrice, and all sorts of good Mid East food. We ate and drank for a couple of\nhours.  I then got my room and changed to go to the beach.  The beach was\nman-made and enclosed by a lagoon where I sat in the sun the rest of the\nafternoon.  At 7PM some of us met to go get some drinks before dinner.  We\nwalked to the Trader Vic's next to the hotel and found it open but empty.\nThey apparently don't believe in happy hour.  We had some drinks and ate\nthere.  At 11 PM we left there to go meet up with some people from the ship\nat an Irish Pub. They had Guinness on tap so I was happy.  We followed most\nof the pilots from the Stennis to the Warbler that had a band that rocked\nuntil 2 AM.  We then returned exhausted to the hotel and after making some\nembarrassing late night calls (which of course is daytime in the States) to\nfriends, I went to sleep.\nDay 2\nThe second day started much later as I was sleeping spread eagle on my king\nsized bed and didn't want to leave it-ever.  I stumbled to the beach with a\nheadache and sat on the beach for the entire afternoon.  The 4weeks at sea\nhad apparently wiped out my tolerance.  I walked around the lagoon and took\nit easy.  Since I realized that most restaurant did not start the food\nservice until 9 PM I decided to eat a late lunch at 4 PM which consisted of\nthe same incredible buffet as the day before.  We all met up in the club\nlevel of the hotel around 8 PM for drinks before we decided to eat.  I was\nnot feeling to great but decided to join some of the people who were going\nto the Italian restaurant that was located inside the hotel.  This was an\nexceptional place where the food was very good.  The Veal Milanese rivaled\nthe best I have had in the States.  I felt much better after that and was\nwilling to join the rest of the group going out to a nightclub.  The\nnightclub turned out to be pretty dead and at 2AM we called it a night.\nDay 3\nI woke up around 12PM and again had to fight to get out of bed.  I had set\nmy A/C to very cold and was buried under many soft blankets.  I met up with\na few people and ate lunch at the caf, on the beach. We then walked over to\nthe lagoon and sat on the beach over there for the rest of the afternoon.\nThe best thing about it was that there was a golfcart that drove around with\ndrinks and snacks for everyone.  I read my book and dozed most of the\nafternoon.   The sun was never particular strong the whole time we were\nthere which I think was do to the amount of dust from the Saudi desert 30\nmiles across the Persian Gulf.  It reduces visibility across the entire Gulf\nand into Iran.  3 of us decided to do the tourist thing in Bahrain later in\nthe afternoon.  The only thing we were told to go see was this new mall that\nwas built.  To me it was just like seeing any other mall except it was a\nlittle smaller then US malls.  I didn't buy anything but it was interesting\nto look at prices that were about double US standards.  You can haggle for\nany price including a pair of socks but you couldn't get them to US prices.\nEverything on Bahrain is imported because it is an island.  Upon returning\nto the hotel around 8PM we met up with a group that was going to the\nLebanese restaurant inside the hotel.  This was also rated the best in\nBahrain.  It was quite a feast with 5 main courses spread from 10 PM until 2\nAM with bellydancers and singers entertaining everyone.  It was in a huge\ntent with beautiful Persian carpets everywhere.  I never ate so much and had\na great time. I literally rolled into bed.\nDay 4\nOur last day since we had to get back on the ship tonight.  Liberty expired\nat 6 AM in the morning and it too much of a hassle to try and go in the AM.\nI woke up and spent most of the day doing PwC paperwork by dialing in.\nThere were hundreds of junk emails to toss out and maybe 5 real messages\nover 4 weeks of no connection.  I had the usual time and expense Nazis\nscreaming at me to sign timesheets.  After 3 months and multiple\nexplanations they still don't get that I have no connectivity.  I can't wait\nto see that appear on my GCF.  I got most of what I needed done.  I then\nneeded to get my watch fixed and set out to find an Omega dealer in Bahrain.\nAfter following at least 6 peoples directions to places they swore were\nthere, I gave up and would wait until Dubai.  Dubai is a larger city and has\nmultiple Omega dealers.  For our final meal we decided to again stay at the\nhotel.  There was an excellent Indian restaurant in the hotel.  I couldn't\ntell you the Indian name for the food I ordered but it was curry chicken and\na basmati rice/lamb combination.  Again I ate way too much and had to roll\nout of there.  We packed up and headed to ship around 10 PM.\n\nAll in all it was great to get away from the ship for a couple of days after\nthe 4-week binge.  Bahrain doesn't have much to it and is basically\nsupported by all the Saudi's who drive across every weekend to party.  The\nAmerican base is tiny there.  I am glad the next 3 stops in the Persian Gulf\nwill be Dubai.  I was also told that Dubai has better values on gold and\nrugs.  From now on all of our at-sea-periods will be around two weeks, Thank\nGod!\n\n <<Trader Vics.jpg>>  <<Meridien Pool.jpg>>  <<Meridien Front.jpg>>\n<<Bahrain across Bay.jpg>>  <<Indian Rest Wayne Me Simon Ron.jpg>>\n<<Meridien Beach lagoon.jpg>>  <<Lebanese Rest.jpg>> \n - Trader Vics.jpg\n - Meridien Pool.jpg\n - Meridien Front.jpg\n - Bahrain across Bay.jpg\n - Indian Rest Wayne Me Simon Ron.jpg\n - Meridien Beach lagoon.jpg\n - Lebanese Rest.jpg", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.
