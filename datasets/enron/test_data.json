Electric Business Understanding - November 27 The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries.    Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14 This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.  Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19 This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.  Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20 This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

You have very high standards for your own performance and are highly committed to the best outcome in all situations. You are likely to have high expectations for results from our coaching meetings This a good formula for success and I will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving the action forward.  With this in mind, I had some thoughts and additional questions for reflection following the meeting that I would like to share.  You are in a transition from being a  high team performer to becoming the leader of a high performing team.  One of your frustrations as leader is that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems that arise in the day to day operations of the team.  At first you responded to their requests for help by solving it for them, then you shifted to using questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with  you.  You have also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more independent problem solvers.  You are frustrated when some members of the team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use.  You are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability that they come to you for.  You have recruited people with this ability and you seek to expand it in the team.  This issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our next meeting.  The question is: How to engage the team in solving this problem.  How do I get the members of this team to own this responsibility and begin creating their own solutions?  What resources are needed by each person to contribute more to this problem? How do I involve the team members more in the solving of this problem? What new behaviors do I need to employ to increase the involvement of the team?  What do I need to change in myself or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in the problem?  There is one dimension that I am clear about. I know that you have used performance appraisals to give feedback.  Have you put this issue before the team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual team members?  I look forward to our meeting on the 17th.  Keep growing!

Larry was adamant that there will be no delay in Alberta  and said there is no point in any stakeholder even proposing a delay because  it such a proposal was a \"non-starter\" and won't happen.  He told me during  the discussion that investors will not invest in a jurisdiction where the  government does not follow through with what it says it will do and he  referred to the Jan 1, 2001 date as a firm commitment of the government  entrenched in the legislation.  I agreed with him that this was absolutely  the right approach and told him that the Government had Enron's full support  on this issue.

Both appraisers went in to see the property on Friday June 16, 2000.  We are  expecting one written report today and the other one tomorrow.  We should be  in a position to give you your guarantee price by the middle of next week.  I was advise by Cendant Mobility that your spouse's first name is Dina.   Please advise me if this is not the correct spelling of her name.  I will  correct it in our system.   You can contact me by return e-mail at  Pfournie@Royallepage2.com or by phone at 416-386-6028 or 1-800-410-2983 ext.  6028 Since I'm not totally sure at this point if your family has already vacated  the property in Calgary so I don't want to send any documents there.   I am  attaching three documents to this e-mail so that you have them with you .  The first document is the offer information form and disclosure statement.   Since this document forms part of the guaranteed offer,  and would ask you to  please complete this document and return it to me by fax by Monday June  26th.  My fax# is 416-448-6358.  The second document is a blank guarantee offer.   This document will be used  in the event that you are able to negotiate a verbal agreement with a buyer  prior to a guarantee price being established. If this situation occurs, please insert the agreed upon price and sign the  RLRS Offer,.  Return it by fax , along with the Power of Attorney which forms  part of this package. Once these documents are received by RLRS, we are in a legal position to sign  an offer on your home showing RLRS as the vendor.  The last document is the amended sale program  procedures . This is the  relocation program that has been approved by your company for your  relocation. It outlines in detail the procedures to be followed under that  program. It is a program that has been designed by the I.R.S. and the U.S. relocation  council to deal with the issues of relocation and taxable benefits. One thing that I want to you to remember is that if you have an offer on your  property,  you must negotiate it verbally and please do not signed nor  initial anything on the offer.  Once you have come to a verbal agreement   with a purchaser, Royal Lepage will sign that offer on your behalf.  You can contact me at the office between 8:00 to 4:00 or leave a voice mail  message anytime.  I will be on vacation next week June 26th to June 30th. If you need  assistance during that week please contact Jessica Desouza at 416-510-5764 or  you can use the 800# and ask for ext. 5764.  Jessica will contact you next  week with your guarantee price.  Could you also please e-mail me your mailing address where to courier your  guaranteed offer.

Obviously this is not appropriate for S. America or  Oceania and Asia. It is possible that you have some similar mechanism. - the energy commodity questionnaire considers commodity derivatives trading.  This questionniare was only sent to local counsel in jurisdictions for which  we had not already undertaken derivatives due diligence.  In respect of  physical commodity trading, based on the due diligence we have done to date  in Europe, we have not undertaken any further due diligence for trading via  EOL. If you feel that you need to undertake any physical trading due  diligence, we have a set of questionnaires which I would be happy to pass on  to you to use as you see fit.

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.  The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.    Specific points: EES will be a part of the new company.   Enron assets will be revalued at closing.   The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.   Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%. Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.   ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.   Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.   In what was termed a \"new approach\", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.   Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.   Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'. All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks. Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure. Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.   Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs. Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there. Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.   Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing. Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing. With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash. ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.   BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies. McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks. Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA. Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that. Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger. Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling.  The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing. McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements. ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list. The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron. Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.   McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized. Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies. Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash. ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given). Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.' Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today. Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

I am in the second quarter here. The study and social life is extremely busy at the school. But I enjoy connecting the knowledge I learn everyday here with the experience I had with Enron.  A schoolmate of mine, a Chicago Ph.D. candidate in finance, is looking for an internship for the coming summer. I recommend him to write to you to see if you are interested in or if there is a need. If so, you can contact with him directly. He is a really bright guy. If not, hope you don't mind that I sell Enron at school so hard.  Again, thanks for all the help you gave me. Have a good new year.

So if you will schedule the interview on the 14th of September, I would need to leave around 5:15 PM so I could attend  my  class.  It actually might be more convenient for me to meet with the interviewers on the 15th of September.

She fell asleep on the short ride home which she never does. We bought her an outifit to wear at Old Navy that's not really a \"costume\". It is an orange one piece thing with these cute smiling spiders on it that says \"silly spiders\". It was a little boyish, but the pumpkin motif suit was on white t-shirt material and I knew it would be totally stained by the end of the day.  The orange hid those pesky carrots and peaches! We took pictures of her holding on to the gourd jack-o-lantern yesterday morning.  I think she enjoyed watching the kids come to our door for candy, but she really didn't like the doorbell much at all. The \"Hamlets\" slummed it and left their million dollar house area of Alamo Heights to come trick or treat on the old street.  They brought new baby whose name sounds like Frayton - not sure how to spell - but it was fun to see them again. Well, we will hook up another weekend but in the meantime I will send portraits and hopefully some other pics your way.

Amy Fitzpatrick will provide you with  a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by Monday  morning.  We want to have 15 people attend this course.  I realize that this  is short notice, so if you can't attend please let me know ASAP so that I can  find a replacement.  I have been working with Jon Koomey, who will be teaching the course, over  the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the  needs of people who work on this floor.  The goal is to provide a  comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the  foundation of analyzing energy problems.  The course is loosely based on a  graduate level course offered at Berkeley (which Jon has taught and several  people on the floor have taken) and on a book that Jon Koomey recently  published.  This is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being  offered.  As a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress.  Chris  Calger and I would like every person in this office to have the opportunity  to take this course between now and the end of the year.  We have selected a  cross-section of people for this first session.  Some people have a lot of  experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.   Some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others  are new to the business.  We are hoping that the course will be helpful to  people with different backgrounds.  Each participant in the class is not only  responsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give  constructive feedback to Jon Koomey and to us on how to make the course  better.  You will have both formal and informal opportunities to provide  feedback.  This feedback is part of the program.  If you aren't willing or  don't feel that you have the time to take this one-day course and provide us  with thoughtful, constructive suggestions on how to improve the course for  the next time please let me know and your name will be removed from the list  for this session.  Based on the feedback from this course, we will make modifications before the  next course is offered in a month or so.  With your help, we will be able to  improve the training for the people who come after you.  Thanks in advance  for your help with this, and I hope that you find this training to be helpful.

This resulted in a GTC Purchase Firm contract being set-up in the  Global Contracts System.  The term of the GTC was set as the term of the deal  (4/1/00 thru 3/31/01) with no evergreen, meaning that the contract will  expire at the end of this month.  To the best of my knowledge, all GTC Purchase Firms have the same language &  they do not have evergreen.  They expire at the end of the primary term.  So, unless Exxon negotiated a deal with different, special language to allow  for evergreen & included something about a \"10 day notification\" to  terminate, there isn't any reason to \"terminate\" this contract.  If this is the case, please advise.  Otherwise, I don't think we need to do  anything.  The contract will expire at the end of this month on its own.

Sell to CPR Pipeline Exchange (parking gas) -   Price = $0 Buy from CPR Pipeline Exchange (getting gas back) Price = $0  When the deal crosses a month - if you keep the risk within the desk - in the  short term you record a big loss - sell at $0 - and the  next month you record a big gain - buy at $0.   To manage this - usually the  cash desk swaps out the time risk to a storage financial book - who will pick  up the time  spread loss and offsetting gain - as this book captures forward value.      When you are adjusting your physical injections (parking) within the month -  you will need to adjust your swaps too - which will adjust the P&L for the time spread  accordingly - otherwise you will have liquidation problems.

Maybe you  could e-mail me the correct one.  Anyway seeing as I am interrupting your  work day I might as well carry on.     I sure do worry about you two, living and working  in what is sure to be a hot spot for who knows what.  You don't think you  could talk Beth into moving to Canada.  I know we are not safe either but  Houston is so far away and maybe  we are just a little  safer.  I watched Oprah yesterday and she had people in the know  on  about the safety of the airlines.  Those people said it is not safe to fly  so how are we to return to normal?  It is going to take months to train air  marshalls.  Are you sure you are going to Florida for  Thanksgiving?   What are the thoughts for Christmas?  Think about  Calgary, you could have dinner with the family, visit your  friends and maybe go skiing.  The bad thing is you have to fly here.   Anyway you can let me know.   I talk to Grandpa almost every day.  He is  having a hard time.  He is very lonely.  I talked to the nurse at the  hospital where my Mum is.  She had a bad spell and was threatening to  commit suicide.  A psychiatrist evaluated her and prescribed some  medication because she is so anxious. He said he thought she had vascular dementia and  not alzheimers because she was able to answer questions.  They were  not all the right answers but he said, a person with alzheimers isn't  able to figure out that it was a question and therefore respond.  She did  have radiation treatment long ago on the back of her head for cancer.  I  always wondered if damage was done at that time.  I'm telling you this so  you don't feel so threatened by the disease in the family.   Your Dad  was laughing and said: \" Wouldn't it be scary if my Mum ended up being the  most with it of the folks ?\"   I know life just gets more  depressing.     I will send some pictures from Dad's birthday to  you soon.  I think we need to get a scanner and then it would be quicker  although I guess you go through a lot more cartridges when you print out  pictures.  Steve has gone to B.C. for his competition this weekend.   He doesn't have any aspirations of winning but says at least he did it.  He  got down to 155 lbs.  so made light weight.  I'm hoping he goes back  to real food but stays in shape.     How is the squash game going?  Has Beth beat  you yet?  Are you still golfing?  We are pretty well done with   the golf but curling started Thursday.  Both Dad and Robert were away so  Joanne and I and two spares managed to get a win.  Joanne skipped and I  played second.  By the way, Joanne thinks she is moving to Toronto with  work.  She said probably Nov. 1st.  I guess Mirant bought the last of  Trans Canada Pipeline and so she and some marketing guy will  set up  the Toronto office.  I read in the paper that this makes Mirant only  second to the U.S. giant,  Enron.  Meanwhile Mirant was moving  into Eau Clair this weekend as they need more space.   I'm sorry I rambled on.   If you get  me the right address for Beth, I'll bug her next time.  Love to both of you  and please keep safe.

In my search for  co-foounder/collaborators and angel investors, disclosing the concept (for lack of a better title now, I  call the system \"LifeTrak\") and formulating a simple, clear picture is not easy.  The attached schematic  depicts an overview of the effort.  Part of the diagram hopes to separate the special interests as  participants and member organizations so as to be helpful in the public sector with social issues.   The groups fall into two natural sectors;  (1) supply generators; and (2) user/service organizations.   In the middle is the system and its management that interconnects those benefiting groups and the  donor/recipient LifeTrak cardholders.  I can embellish more on these later.  The diagram gives us a  place to begin discuss and talking points in order to try to simplify how the concept could be developed  and supported and where the revenue model which creates dramatic efficiencies generates management and  license fee.

Based upon these suggestions, the ISC is implementing a new time entry process to record holiday time, which is effective immediately, beginning with the February 16-28, 2001, time-entry period.    Holiday pay for all eligible employees must be entered as \"Company Observed Holiday\", and the recent company-observed holiday of President's Day (Monday, February 19, 2001) must be coded \"Company Observed Holiday\".  However, if you're an employee who works a 12-hour shift schedule, there are no changes to your time entry process for Holiday pay.  Please continue to record your holiday time in the usual manner.  If you're a salaried, non-exempt employee and you work a holiday, you must enter \"Company Observed Holiday\" for that holiday and enter \"Regular Work Time\" for all hours worked on the holiday to ensure proper payment of overtime for the day.    Discretionary holiday time has been limited to eight (8) hours for all eligible employees, per the Enron Policy on Work Hours/Holidays/Vacation (<http://hrweb.enron.com/policyandprocedure/docs/12-hours.pdf>).   eHRonline will not allow you to record more than eight (8) hours per calendar year under the \"Discretionary Holiday\" time-entry code.    Detailed instructions on coding holiday time are available within SAP eHRonline Process Bulletin HR -01-04, which can be accesed through the following link:  http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=145.  If you have questions regarding this new eHRonline functionality, please contact the ISC Call Center at (713) 345-4SAP (4727).

Listed below are  the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:    As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts)  and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is  essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct  a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The  pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and  available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a  secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts  feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or  Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.   The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the  completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system  is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your  Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated  correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are  unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or  Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.  Supervisors You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the  Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate  this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at  your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not  conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the  rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.   Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at  x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to  provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have  been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final  cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are  responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be  representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind  that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will  ensure that the final PRC is a success.  Associates/Analysts You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received  your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this,  please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system  and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many  people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your  reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of  reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will  also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the  opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you  have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may  hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do  not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.    An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000  at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and  Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be  communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be  communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.

This memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring=20 error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive \"promotion.= \"  At the time of the interview process, there was no position in Enron=20 designated as \"Professional Meteorologist.\"  In fact, the most recent simil= ar=20 hire prior to that date was Jose Marquez, also a professional meteorologist= ,=20 who was hired in, based on salary alignment criteria, as a manager.  While= =20 functionally, both these men are meteorologists, Enron has no such job=20 classification. Compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional=20 professional expertise in short time order, it was difficult to peg the=20 proper Enron classification appropriate for this new position.  This origin= al=20 uncertainty and resulting misplacement of Stephen into the Specialist=20 category, rather than the Senior Specialist category, needs to be corrected= =20 at this time.  Although a \"new-hire\" to Enron, Stephen Bennett has extensive work=20 experience.  He has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the=20 Weather Services Corporation in Boston and at The Weather Channel in=20 Atlanta.  He came to Enron well-referenced by both those organizations,=20 needing no further training and only minimal supervision.  Once aboard here in Houston, Stephen immediately demonstrated the core Enro= n=20 values with our unique sense of urgency.  After only a week, he assumed=20 responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager= =20 level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather= =20 briefings to the gas traders.  This includes analysis and report preparatio= n=20 as well as presentation.  Also in the presentation arena, he now regularly= =20 briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day.  Stephen is a= =20 master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through=20 other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous.  Stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self-initiative.  = He=20 designed, implemented, and now maintains several sub-sites on the Research= =20 web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific: the weather= =20 derivatives team, the agricultural team, and most recently, the crude and= =20 liquids team.  I have recently assigned Stephen to spearhead our conversion= =20 and major upgrade of this web page.  These above described accomplishments are above and beyond Stephen=01,s reg= ular=20 duties which include starting work at 5 am daily, reliably and without fail= ,=20 to assemble and prepare our trader=01,s weather report.

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total  car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing  provisions (i.e. insurance).  National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value  proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first  choice for Enron travelers' needs.  Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract  reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and  low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National,  where available.  When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or  Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate  selected:  1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or  Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for  any damage to it.  2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle.  For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000  per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage.  ** IMPORTANT *** These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following  contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded  on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974) To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's  preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in  National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club  membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the  transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid  return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron  travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron  American Express T&E Cardholders.

Fox Sports Show Host Jim Rome  1)   They won't shut up. They have to go on about spirit, and old army,and red ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat UT, and blah blah blah. Shut up. You start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite UT. 2)   Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the 1870's passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school (University of Texas) that would teach agriculture and mechanics. Aggies love to say their school is older, from where they get that I don't  now......the fact is, the State intended A&M to be a branch of UT. They are like the afterbirth fromthe original creation.  Like Danny Devito in \"Twins\". 3)   So they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good. All the while, nobody at UT denies that A&M is a good school, yet they won't shut up. So they write a fight song......about?....Texas, and how they want to beat them. They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell them how bad Texas is and how good A&M and all its traditions are. It is the world's largest known case of penis envy, and it is manifested in everything A&M does. 4)   The people at A&M. Now we all have friends who went to A&M or are at A&M. There are some nice people there. However...there is the Corp.  East Texas' answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere. For every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys, there is the Corp. Now, forget the fact that A&M will actually let people with sub-par grades enroll if they agree to join the Corp. Forget the fact that the Corps looked like a Gestapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field in 1995. Forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed against them, and swept under the rug over the years, they just this past month have had one Corps member bring charges against another Corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for a little actual sodomy.  Not only could I go on with more instances of idiocracy by these Khaki-clad-shaven-headed-dorks, I am sure each of you have your own stories. The point is: We all respect West Point, Annapolis, The Air Force Academy; however, nobody respects the Corp. I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world. Just because you dress like the Army, and try and act like the Army, does not make you the Army. People at A&M don't even respect these clowns. It is not cool to shave your head and dress up. Halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year. If you want to carry guns and beat up civilians, move to Israel. 5)   It is even less cool to slobber on somebody's daughter on national television and call it a tradition. Dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool. Not only is it not cool, it should be against the law. I know that in College Station, students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face. But everywhere else in the world, it is looked down upon. Especially if you are doing it on my TV. That is why we have moved the game from Thanksgiving. Because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game, some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody's Thanksgiving dinner. We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board. Some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter. Screw that, forget make-up, it is too late for that, just give them a veil. 6)   \"t.u.\" is not funny. It is NOT insulting. It is dumb. Just imagine if folks from Texas kept talking about M&A and giggling. That would not be funny. In fact, it would be retarded. That's why UT fans don't do it. Please learn. 7)   You want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond of sheep, of people that aren't stupid? Then quit building things that fall down.Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV. Quit whooping in church. Quit whooping period. Quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals. Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yell. Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you're running for Governor. When you are filling out season ticket renewals, and the form asks for your phone #, H & W, quit putting 258-3999, Height 6'3\", Weight 185.  Just, collectively, stop making asses of yourselves. Go to East Texas, tour every small town, and ask every red neck with a 5th grade education why they cheer for A&M and wear maroon. That is your fan base. This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid. 8)   Nobody cares if you think your band is better. They might be louder, they might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability.  The point is, nobody cares who wins halftime. Quit getting geeked up about marching bands. I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band's entire halftime performance. And why? Cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now. Plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care. Why is it cool all of a sudden now that you're in college? 9)   Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. Perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe. Oh wait...I understand now. 10)  Dogs are not ladies. They don't look or smell like ladies. Dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly. 11)  Finally, College Station is an arm-pit of a town. Quit pretending that it is a great college town. It is a town and there is a college there.That should be the end of this comparison. If you feel that life doesn't get any better than the Dixie Chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending \"Dukes of Hazard\" episode, then move there. More importantly, don't move to Austin.....they are trying to create an educated, technological, and open minded population base. Austin is, and will continue to be, the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool.

Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We= =20 want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=  =20 Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation= =20 and our position on California energy issues.  What happened in California  The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp= ly=20 and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr= eased=20 the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20 restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So= =20 demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul= t,=20 predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.  In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related= =20 factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations= =20 forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for= =20 power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market= =20 when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo= ng=20 term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I= n=20 California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20 equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th= e=20 most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20 while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat= t=20 was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.  Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain= ed=20 in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20 competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa= le=20 prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20 regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.  In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat= ion. =20 Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new= =20 generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile= =20 spot prices.  At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned= =20 the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w= hich,=20 if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.  Enron=01,s Role  Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f= ix=20 the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20 politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:  ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the= =20 state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the= =20 same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20 market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar= e=20 interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc= ts=20 for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from= =20 the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We= =20 protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.  You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20 power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on= =20 the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=  of our=20 customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:  ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20 market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct= ly=20 from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20 allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue = to=20 receive the financial benefits of their contract prices. ? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them= =20 with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20 reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.  Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its= =20 crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20 continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western= =20 power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom= ers=20 with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more= =20 demand for our products and services.  The Solution  The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary= , the=20 state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark= et=20 and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.  Increasing Supply  California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing= =20 short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les= s=20 than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl= y=20 must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20 generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the= =20 regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20 displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can= =20 have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20 facilities.  Reducing Demand  Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. = =20 They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail= =20 market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman= d=20 at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market= .  Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market  In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20 volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer= =20 term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han= ds=20 of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market= . =20 Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the= ir=20 price risk.  Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions  The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20 greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to= =20 arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov= er=20 their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and= =20 distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is= =20 needed.  Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that= ,=20 while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters= =20 worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work= ed;=20 and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages= ,=20 which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20 ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether = it=20 is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall= ey=20 or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20 shortage worse.  The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20 California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that= =20 the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20 constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in= =20 California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20 generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road= s=20 and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.  As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t= he=20 crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=  will=20 continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20 solutions to the state.

First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New York and all Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You can rest assured that anything and everything that can be done to assure the safety of our country will be done. This is the greatest country in the world and we will get through this trying time. Now is the time for all people to set aside our petty differences and show the world that no one or nothing can destroy the fortitude of the American people. To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight? Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know who you are fucking with? Americans are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other every day. We will relish that opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We slapped them all over the Pacific and roasted about 2 million of them in their own back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen Texas on a map? Ever wonder why it's so big? Because  we wanted it that way, Mexico started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns. England? We sent them packing. Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole USA. The only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard to shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our soldiers aren't trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now he couldn't stop a pack of cub scouts from taking over his shitty little country. Trust us, Afghanistan will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden. There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high enough that's going to keep your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he was there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that have pissed us off in the past. This is America. We kick ass. This is what we do.

This adjustment arrangement doesn't seem to be  papered - it's just occurred each month for the past 5 years on a relatively  routine basis.  Since the adjustment arrangement isn't papered, we've been having difficulty  properly reflecting the deal in sitara and unify.  It has been suggested that  we try to paper the deal for posterity (the lease to TECO has 9 more years to  run), but, in view of the forthcoming expiration of the primary term of both  the Comstock and Oryx (Sun and/or Kerr-McGee) contracts, I'm reluctant to  open this can of worms.  I'd like your thoughts.  George x3-6992  ---------------------- Forwarded by George Weissman/HOU/ECT on 03/29/2000  07:53 AM ---------------------------      Enron North America Corp.

HPLR once had an appropriate agreement in place, but that  agreement has been assigned to ECT.  Until the agreement can be re-assigned  from ECT to HPLC, we will use spot GTCs to clear the puchase/sale accounts  for the period from 10/98 to 6/99 or perhaps 7/99.

In April '99, these contracts  were assigned to ECT.  In October of 1998, these contracts should have been  assigned to HPLC, but did not get assigned.  Beginning in Jan. '99, negative  volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under Sitara  #18372 (meter #6884), causing my payments to be reduced.  I believe that the  deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract.  (The  purchase deal numbers which I have been using are Sitara #14086 and Sitara  #11079).  Both these sales and purchases (since October '98) are suppose to  be for HPLC.  Donald Reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale GTC's  between Teco and HPLC can be set up from October of 1998 until the Master  Contract is changed.  Amelia Alland has set these up, which I believe  terminate in October '99.  The GTC spot contract numbers are as follows:   Purchases:  012-86978-102; Global 96021450  Sales: 012-86978-301; Global 96021451   Per our conversation earlier can you make these retroactive adjustments?   When complete, can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be?

All along, these volumes  have been flowing into the GEPL/Big Cowboy system and on to King Ranch.  Tom  and I spoke with Clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and  determined that a Transport Usage ticket needed to be put into place, as IM  Wellhead, to transfer the volumes from HPL to GEPL and into the plant.

More importantly, however,  Tim simply wants to tighten procedures as a risk control mechanism.  He also  will be writing procedures for other things various folks in his group do.  These procedures will be put into a West Trading Procedure Book that is being  created.  To get this process started (prior to my writing it up), please  immediately start doing the following:  1.  On every future trade you do, tell the trader taking the position (i.e LT  NW, ST CA, etc.) that you should be identified as the trader.  By doing this,  you will be responsible for making sure the deal is confirmed properly.   Otherwise, they are responsible for the accuracy of the Confirm.   2.  I will be sent a copy of all MM group confirms from Houston and will be  putting them into a Master MM Confirms notebook.  When received, I will  indicate to you that it is here and you will be responsible for checking it  and making sure it is accurate.  An accurate confirm generally means the deal  was entered correctly into EnPower. 3.  For all existing deals that you think should be included in this notebook  because they are a little hairy and you want to make sure your hands are  clean with respect to an accurate confirm, please make sure I get a copy as  soon as possible.

After  working  for  seven  years  on  credit   risk management  in  a  research and consulting capacity, I would like to transfer  my experience  in  assessing  credit  risk  modeling,  information  technology   and methodology  in  complex  top-tier  institutions  to  an  active  credit  trading managerial   environment.   I  am  excited  about  being  involved  in   trading, origination, risk management and R&D of credit derivatives.  I  have  seven years of experience in credit risk measurement and  management.  I have  helped  design,  test  and implement credit value-at-risk systems with  KMV Corp  and  with  a  major  Japanese  bank.   I was a major contributor at KMV  in designing the Expected Default Frequency model and I am thoroughly familiar  with its  assumptions,  strengths,  weaknesses and applications.  I did the  empirical research  that  lies  behind the KMV default correlation model, the private  firm EDF  model  and  I interfaced with J.P. Morgan (now R.M.G.) personnel during  the creation of the CreditMetrics documentation.  I  have  excellent analytical, quantitative, statistical and programming  skills. I studied finance extensively when I was a graduate student and I studied  credit risk theory while I worked with KMV and Arthur Andersen.  I am eager to join  the credit derivative team at Enroncredit.com where I am certain that my  combination of   quantitative   research  skills,  credit  risk  consulting  experience   and technology   expertise   make  me  uniquely  qualified  to  support  the   credit derivatives trading and risk management function.  I  have  included  my  resume  with this e-mail.  Please e-mail me or call me  at 201-420-0191  (home)  and  212-708-4027  (work)  so  that  we  can  discuss  this opportunity further.

As you'll see, our changes are reflected either by underline  or strikeout in each of the documents.  The 3 attachments below are as  follows:    1.  ENA financial GTC   2.  Enron Canada financial GTC   3.  ENA HDD swap GTC  As you know, ENA financial (credit) and Enron Canada financial (credit) GTCs  exist in addition to the ENA financial and Enron Canada financial GTCs.  The  language that we inserted in the attached ENA financial and Enron Canada  financial GTCs should also be inserted in the ENA financial (credit) and  Enron Canada financial (credit) GTCs.  In addition, there are several weather  derivative swap GTCs.  The language set forth in the attached ENA HDD swap  GTC will need to be inserted in all other ENA weather derivative swap GTCs  (credit and non-credit).  Also, please note that the message you forwarded to me from Leslie Hansen  appears to relate to the U.S. state tax language to be inserted into certain  GTCs.

However, it is very difficult to follow the discussion due to a practical  problem: we hear little or nothing at times.  A possible solution to this problem might be to ask whether one could install  a \"spider phone\" in the VaR meeting room.

If this is done, we  would  hear everyone around the table,  not just those seated close to the phone.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20 relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to= =20 directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units= =20 has become increasingly difficult.  Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin= g=20 the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20 hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin= g=20 asset positions.  And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to= =20 redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.  ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES  Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate= =20 our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20 businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20 coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to= =20 higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20 opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o= f=20 Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an= d=20 markets.

Greg Whalley,=20 currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office= =20 of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.  Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our= =20 international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi= p=20 positions:  Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President= =20 and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit= y=20 for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N= orth=20 America and Europe.

Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to= =20 the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20 transition, Jim will join EES.  In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20 activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale= =20 businesses and the commercial support functions:  Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=  and=20 CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20  Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for= =20 operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20 marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor= t=20 into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility= =20 for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20 America.

This alignment creates a coordinat= ed=20 services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20 wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these= =20 services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will= =20 continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible= =20 for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.

I still cannot imagine that the courts in Texas will allow some foreigner to come here and take assets from honest Texans.  Jeanne tells me that there is a lot of politics involved, that the FBI is interested in pursuing Lloyds on some securities fraud or investment scam charges, but that the British government is trying to intervene.  I've got no idea what it means, but if I were you, I would consider all my decisions with the thought of protection against a bad court outcome as a possibility. As a practical matter, this means:  Keep all trust or estate assets in the trust or estate, minimize your non-exempt assets, and maximize your exempt assets, such as taking any exposed funds and putting them into pension funds or paying off a mortgage on a homestead.

I've been meaning to e-mail you back for the last week.  It has been on my list of things to do and of course I'm procrastinating.  I even promised my brother John I would get back with you on Monday.  Well I didn't fulfill that promise but I'm just one day late.  Leon Kent is still alive!  Tell Leon that I get monthly correspondance from Equitas and that I trash it.   They are still trying to get names to rejoin.  There is nothing knew that is happening at Lloyd's except the usual propaganda that is put out by the groups that were formed in hopes of suing Lloyd's.  They tend to send out material saying that Lloyd's can still come after names after they have settled with Equitas.  Back to the trusts - I really was hoping that you/the firm would take over. When I said that I wouldn't handle the accounting of the trusts because of family difficulties, I was refering to my oldest brother, John, who has a law degree and knows enough to ask questions and he keeps asking questions that I get stressed trying to answer and then we get into an arguement. I wanted someone who knows what their doing to handle the trusts because he won't ask them any questions and it is worth it to me so I can have peace and quiet.  (George knows John.)  John had heard good press about you and was very comfortable if you were interested in handling the trusts once Chase Bank is removed as trustee.  Bill who is extremely easy going will go with anything.  I hope that work has slowed down now that the 15th is over and that you've had a chance to catch your breath.

In my clients, I've got four or five Lloyds members.  some took the Equitas settlement, some remain Lloyds names, and some just quit answering the mail.  My basic advice to Leon is -- ignore them, they aren't going to make you the test case for going after assets in Texas.  But, before I give it to him, is there anything new at Lloyds that you are aware of?  What are you doing about it?  Hope all is well.  Did you get my answer on the trust issues?

But there is still more to come! On May 1st the iBuyit Payables system will be activated for all organizations supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers.  The new iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of receipt and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issue resolution.   In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the way you currently order and pay for goods and services.  Following these changes will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit Payables system.   Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when placing an order and instruct them to reference this information:    *  Company Number or Legal Entity Name *  Contact Name  *  Personal External Identification Number (EID) or Approved Purchase Order Number    *  New P.O. Box  (See Below)  What is an EID?  An EID is your External Identification Number (EID). This EID number identifies the purchaser and helps route non-purchase order invoices back to the purchaser electronically through iBuyit.    Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders? Yes.  When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID.  It is your responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for non-purchase orders.  Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders? No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do.     What if I do not know my EID? All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number.  You can access your EID number in eHRonline.  Logon to eHRonline, choose \"Personal Information\" to pull up your personal profile.  On the left side of the \"Personal Information\" screen select \"Other\" and you will see your: *  PID (SAP ID) *  GIS ID *  EID  What is our new mailing address (PO Box)? Effective immediately, instruct the vendor to mail the invoices to the following address: PO Box 4734   Houston, TX  77210-4734  What do I do if an invoice comes directly to me? HOUSTON LOCATIONS ONLY If an invoice comes directly to you, mark the envelope \"Attention Enron Accounts Payable,\" and place the envelope in an AP drop box at any Enron mail center.  FIELD LOCATIONS ONLY If Houston currently processes your invoices, and an invoice comes directly to you, they will continue to be processed by the Accounts Payable department in Houston.  Please send invoices to the new PO Box above or the following physical address:   3724 Dacoma Houston, TX  77092 ATTENTION ENRON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  Note:  ETS Field locations will continue to process non-purchase order invoices locally.  How will vendors learn about these changes? This information will be shared directly with vendors in a separate communication.  Questions?

One is as a financial economist.  The other as the Director of the newly formed \"Global Mobility Innovation Initiative (GMII) -- this is the research project funded by Lucent, involving BU, LBS, and INSEAD, to study various aspects of the mobile Internet (read 3G).  On the former I am working with a couple of Ph.D. students in understanding  (a) details of how having physical supply (inventory) can be used by a market maker.   This is a problem that has been studies in the context of specialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting in the way Enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth.    I think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber  that is in the ground.  (b) how Enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market.  This is in many ways the critical aspect of  real options that most finance people miss -- having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another.  All of the incomplete contracting, asymmetric information, and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models.  But they are real in practice.  My impression is Enron's real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining.  (c) how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals, financials, credit etc.  This is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore, include non-linear risk profiles.  The story of gas  is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets Enron has been moving into over the last few years.  On the GMII front, I think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber.   I am working with several people at Lucent on this issue.  I think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room.  I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues.  Perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call. Clearly, having Vince Kaminski in the room would be very important to me.  As for schedules, the first 3 weeks of April are horrible.  April 26/27, May 3/4 are good for me.

Believe it or not, it actually is \"good to be back.\"   And thanks to Louise's timely intervention, I actually get to stay in Houston  this week instead of coming over to London for the ISDA meetings.  We discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions  yesterday and Mark Dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers  actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines.  He and I  are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your  note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the  lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions.  The other topics I had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching  of GTC's with products and continued progress on the Counterparty spreadsheet.  Harry Collins is the emissions guy.  I'm assuming he'll be part of this  process tomorrow and I'll ask him to take a close look at the long  descriptions and how the mesh with the GTC's.  Finally, I agree with you on the GTC variables issue.  My plan is to ask the  lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for  which they are responsible.  With me here to answer questions that may result  in more progress but I'm still not convinced that's enough.  I hope to be  able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last  couple of weeks but realistically I don't think that will happen very soon.   Maybe you can help me prioritize:  should I look first at areas with  predicted high volume or areas where we have the least confidence in the  quality of work to date?  Talk to you soon.  Mark    David Forster 09/14/99 07:06 AM To: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Legal Stuff  Mark,  Welcome back!  I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of  EnronOnline:  1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email) 2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as  the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to  individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of  the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed  this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a  representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes  coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I  have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) -  otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from  the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved.  It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access  the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products.  Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access  the long descriptions in the Product Manager   3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these  with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who  should be looking after this?    Mark Taylor   Leslie Hansen   Jeff Hodge   Janice Moore   Alan Aronowitz   Harry Collins   Stacy Dickson   4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have  been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work  together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this  area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's  against the products and see what you think?

Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.   HOW TO ENROLL:  1.  Print out the attached registration form.  2.  Complete the form, but please note the following    SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:   A.  Fill out the student information completely, including    your email address.   B.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:  The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially improve in a short period of time.  THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:  All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.

I have detected a tendency to implement different  approaches to valuation in the past.   To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal  rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques  which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the  originators to control the outcomes.

I'm hearing confusing messages about the way that the UK IT team and the UK  traders get their Valuation code aparently signed off by Research, while  here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.   We have now a situation where the UK team are using a home grown Valuation  piece called DOVE, where results differ from those of the equivalent USA  portcalc.

I've done some research as follows:  1/95 shows delivery on transport contract #012-82269-02-002 (Southeastern  Marketing Co. as counterparty)  1/96 thru 10/31/97 shows delivery on transport contract #012-27182-02-001  (Esperanza Marketing Corp as counterparty).  11/97 thru 12/97 shows delivery on 089-41500-102  1/98 shows delivery on  089-41500-101  No other transactions at this meter since 1/98.  Some questions I need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport  contracts through 10/31/97 and then started to be allocated to the 089  contract later?  Are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to  and is that the reason the 089 contract was used?   Or should the transport  contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11/97 forward?  Each  item indicates a delivered volume, so either a transport  or sale is taking  place.    All the information that is supplied on the UA4 report is need a contract for  9,448 MMBTU.

However, the account=20 complaint level measure is particularly biased against fast-growing new=20 entrants like Enron Direct.  Since all of Enron Direct's customers have=20 recently switched suppliers - which is when most complaints occur - and our= =20 total customer base is far lower than that of the RECs, our account complai= nt=20 levels per customer tend to appear inflated versus the REC peer group.   In= =20 fact, Enron Direct's complaint levels for both transfers (i.e., switchers)= =20 and mis-selling, as measured by Ofgem, were well below industry averages. = =20 While we are not yet best-in-class, Enron Direct's portrayal as an industry= =20 laggard in any aspect of customer service is misleading.

Bush's Speech Writer. By Mitchell R. Robb  Good evening my fellow Americans. First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New York and all Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You can rest assured that anything and everything that can be done to assure the safety of our country will be done. This is the greatest country in the world and we will get through this trying time. Now is the time for all people to set aside our petty differences and show the world that no one or nothing can destroy the fortitude of the American people. To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight? Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know who you are fucking with? Americans are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other every day. We will relish that opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We slapped them all over the Pacific and roasted about 2 million of them in their own back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen Texas on a map? Ever wonder why it's so big? Because  we wanted it that way, Mexico started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns. England? We sent them packing. Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole USA. The only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard to shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our soldiers aren't trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now he couldn't stop a pack of cub scouts from taking over his shitty little country. Trust us, Afghanistan will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden. There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high enough that's going to keep your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he was there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that have pissed us off in the past. This is America. We kick ass. This is what we do. Go ahead and laugh now, but the Tomahawks are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses. God bless America!     _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "Please see attached.

I know that  this time of year is extremely  hectic, and that it's tough to think about anything past the holidays, but life  does go on past the week of December 25 through January 1, and that's what I'd  like you to think about for a minute.   On the calender that I handed out at the beginning  of the fall semester, the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of January  5-6.  But because of a youth ministers conference that Brad and Dustin are  connected with that week, we're going to change the date to the following  weekend, January 12-13.  Now comes the part you need to think  about.   I think we all agree that it's important for us to  get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far  into the spring semester, but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult  for us to get away without kids, etc.  So, Brad came up with a potential  alternative for how we can get together on that weekend, and then you can let me  know which you prefer.   The first option would be to have a  retreat similar to what we've done the past several years.  This year  we could go to the Heartland Country Inn (www.heartlandcountryinn.com )  outside of Brenham.  It's a nice place, where we'd have a 13-bedroom  and a 5-bedroom house side by side.  It's in the country, real relaxing,  but also close to Brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from  here.  We can golf, shop in the antique and craft stores in Brenham, eat  dinner together at the ranch, and spend time with each other.  We'd meet on  Saturday, and then return on Sunday morning, just like what we've done in the  past.   The second option would be to stay here in  Houston, have dinner together at a nice restaurant, and then have dessert  and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that Saturday  evening.  This might be easier, but the trade off would be that we wouldn't  have as much time together.  I'll let you decide.   Email me back with what would be your preference,  and of course if you're available on that weekend.  The democratic process  will prevail--majority vote will rule!  Let me hear from you as soon as  possible, preferably by the end of the weekend.  And if the vote doesn't go  your way, no complaining allowed (like I tend to do!)   Have a great weekend, great golf, great fishing,  great shopping, or whatever makes you happy!

Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, or the shotgun formation.  8.) Sunday = Sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.  9.) Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that way.  10.) When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.  Really.  11.) You have enough clothes. You have too many shoes.  12.) Crying is blackmail.  13.) Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't work. Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say it!  14.) No, we don't know what day it is. We never will.

I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself  to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll  in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka  Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of  several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the  Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my  observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of  data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to  get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with  this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this  month as the \"bar is being raised\" by the management of Energy Operations for  data quality and timeliness.  The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial  teams.  Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the  requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity  driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of  day Friday, June 2.  Please note the following updates: For Nat Gas, Sally Beck is interested in physical (as denoted as PH in the  survey) vs. financial (as denoted as FI in the survey) numbers, please  provide statistics accordingly If a driver has not been updated per your request, please call or email  Jennifer Reside If you have additional updates / suggestions or items that need correction,  please call or email Jennifer Reside  If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the  surveyed data, please send the report to Jennifer Reside.  This will  eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month.  If you would like  us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next  month, please let Jennifer know.

Sorry about that and so glad you caught it. I multiplied by 1.5 and I meant to use 1.3.  We have discounted deployment paks which we discount by quantity.

TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES  This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.  America: The Good Neighbor.  Widespread but only partial news coverage was given  recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from  Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television  Commentator. What follows is the full text of his  trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional  Record:    \"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the  Americans as the most generous and possibly the  least appreciated people on all the earth. Germany,  Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy  were lifted out of the debris of war by the  Americans who poured in billions of dollars and  forgave other billions in debts.   None of these countries is today paying even the  interest on its remaining debts to the United  States. When France was in danger of collapsing in  1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and  their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the  streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.   When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the  United States that hurries in to help. This spring,  59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes.  Nobody helped. The Marshall Plan and the Truman  Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged  countries. Now newspapers in those countries are  writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.   I'd like to see just one of those countries that is  gloating over the erosion of the United States  dollar build its own airplane. Does any other  country in the world have a plane to equal the  Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the  Douglas DC10?   If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the  International lines except Russia fly American  Planes? Why does no other land on earth even  consider putting a man or woman on the moon? You  talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.  You talk about German technocracy, and you get  automobiles. You talk about American technocracy,  and you find men on the moon - not once, but several  times - and safely home again.   You talk about scandals, and the Americans put  theirs right in the store window for everybody to  look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued  and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most  of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are  getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to  spend here.   When the railways of France, Germany and India were  breaking down through age, it was the Americans who  rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the  New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an  old caboose. Both are still broke.   I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced  to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name  me even one time when someone else raced to the  Americans in trouble? I don't think there was  outside help even during the San Francisco  earthquake.    Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one  Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get  kicked around. They will come out of this thing  with their flag high. And when they do, they are  entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are  gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada  is not one of those.\"   Stand proud, America! Wear it proudly!!  *************************************************************** This is one of the best editorials that I have ever  read regarding the United States. It is nice that  one man realizes it. I only wish that the rest of  the world would realize it. We are always blamed for  everything, and never even get a thank you for the  things we do.   I would hope that each of you would send this to as  many people as you can and emphasize that they  should send it to as many of their friends until  this letter is sent to every person on the web.

Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.    ? After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.  ? The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.

An Enron Director or  above {With Signature Authority to legally bind Enron to a contract} will  have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be  installed. Delivery times on new machines are normally 3-5 working days but  either Vendor listed below will be able to provide a \"Loaner\" should you have  a business need. Please discuss the Fax Machine Install Date with the Rep  when ordering the equipment.  If there is no existing fax line present, you will need to send a Notes-Mail  to the Move Team {Erica @ x3-3185 or Janelle @ x5-7917} requesting the  installation of a new fax line. The Move Team can be found in the Notes-Mail  \"ECT Address Book\".  If you are an EES employee, you must first get new equipment approval from  EES Budget Control. Contact Susan McLeroy @ x5-8066 or via Notes-Mail.  If you are an EBS employee, you must first get new equipment approval from  EBS Purchasing & Budget Control. Contact Paula Corey @ x3-9948 or Martha  Reyna @ x3-3491. You can reach both of these people via Notes-Mail.  If you are an ENA employee, you must first get new equipment approval from  ENA Finance & Budget Control. Contact Lorie Belsha @ x3-9617 or via  Notes-Mail.

All the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated @ 33.6 Kbps versus  the Canon LaserClass 7500 {Example only} @ 14.4 Kbps = New fax machine should  be noticeably quicker. Document feeder capacity of the machines listed below are the same as the  Canon LaserClass 7500             {Example only} Maintenance = Models listed below have Maintenance/Repair coverage included  in monthly $ total. There is NO separate agreement! Toner/Drum cartridges +  paper + line charges are extra {Not quoted}  Contract pricing can change without warning, so please let me know ASAP if a  Vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various  models.  If the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment, here are some  considerations: No more than 20 people per fax machine = Take a look @ the fax machine  placement on EB30 or EB31. Disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33.6K Modem and JBIG  compression {or equivalent}. Look for memory upgrades & 2nd paper tray included in monthly cost. {Models  quoted are loaded}.

If you terminate a contract within the  original agreement period, you may be liable for penalty charges as a lot of  Fax Machines are on a non-cancellable lease agreement. The Vendor who  supplied the fax equipment will be able to let you know of any outstanding $  amounts for your existing equipment.

Vince asked me to ask you to put a set of interviews together (as I  understand, Vince himself will be unavailable that day).    Mark Tawney should see him; someone from weather marketing and/or  structuring should see him, e.g. Gary Taylor and/or Michael Nguyen; some more  people from research should grill him on technical and meteorology issues,  e.g. Vasant and/or Zimin as well as Mike Roberts or someone on his team. Phil  has only been a \"quant\" since the departure of Koch's previous weather quant  in February; before that he was Koch's weather \"risk manager\". I am still not  sure what the distinction means, but we do need to find out how much he knows  about option pricing and meteorology. Even though his expressed desire is to  focus on weather derivatives, we should also assess how useful he would be  from research group's perspective, since research will likely be his official  home.   Finally, Jere Overdyke and/or someone else from his group (George Carrick,  if available) should also get a chance to meet with him. I've already spoken  with Phil, but I'd like to sit in with either Vasant or Zimin or Mike when  they interview him, since I wasn't able to ask any technical questions.   If I'm counting correctly, that should amount to five interview sessions,  perhaps less if we interview in groups of two. Phil's resume is enclosed  below.  Joe  P.S.

I wouldn't mind moving back to Austin, but the jobs there just don't pay as much as in Houston.  Everyone wants to stay in Austin after school, so they can lowball you on the cash.  Looking forward to the pictures.  Need to refresh my memory of Cabo.

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.....  My brother's baby passed away from SID's the week I got back from Cabo and so we have been dealing with the funeral and all of the emotions that go with losing someone.  I think the whole ordeal is harder when it is a baby.... So needless to say I have been out of the office way too much and I am so very much behind!  Good news!  I have some pictures that I will be sending to you next week! That way you will not be able to forget what I look like.... I keep forgetting them in my truck but I will make it a priority to send them to you by Tues.  How is everything going for you?  Keeping busy with work and hopefully your social life?  I think that you are the type that works way too many hours!! I am sure that one day you will balance everything out...  Well it has been a full day ( I know it is only 3:00... ) and it is also Friday so I am going to call it good and go home, take a nap and get up in a couple of hours and head down to Seattle with Julie and Angie...  Have a great weekend and I will talk to you Tuesday!  Take Care,  Dee  >>> <Gerald.Nemec@enron.com> 09/20/00 11:35AM >>> Are you still out there?

As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I have been working two years as Lead Scientist and Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue Management Inc. in Houston.  I developed and implemented the mathematical models for Trading Optimization System and Firm Transportation Optimization System.  The Trading Optimization System becomes the most popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy just signed the contract to buy this product yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department, the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15 companies in one or two years.  Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my research and system developing efforts to combine revenue management with risk management. I am confident that I can make significant contributions to Enron in this area.  I would like to thank you again for giving me this opportunity to come to Enron for this interview.

He relayed some  additional requirements which need to be added to the agreement, which  include the following:   1. The price agreed upon is $90,000.  2. D-G will provide system support. 3. No later than 12 months of execution of the agreement, D-G will provide  the source code to Enron.  In the meantime, the source code is to be in  escrow.  Additionally, the source code would be released sooner than the 12  months if any of the following conditions occur:  (i) D-G goes out of  business; (ii) D-G is unable to provide effective technical support; or (iii)  if D-G agrees to release it sooner.  Before I have our attorney add these things to the agreement, we need to  discuss the escrow situation.  Vince mentioned that you had suggested that  your attorney keep the software in escrow.   Is your attorney a U.S.  attorney?  It seems like I may have recalled that way back in March you might  have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney.  Is that the  same person?  Does this attorney work for a large firm, small firm, or solo  practitioner?  Basically, if you could just provides some additional  information about your attorney, I would appreciate it.  We normally would use an Escrow company to put the software in escrow.  We  have dealt with a company here in the U.S. called DSI Technology.  I will  check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney.  Once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow,  we will red-line the agreement to reflect such changes and e-mail it back to  you for your review.

This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.  To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.  The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.  I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.  During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth= =20 and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20 success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a= =20 number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The= =20 goals of such re-alignment include: a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe= e=20 is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set; b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation= =20 with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal= =20 flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to= =20 our trading organization; c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate= =20 our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase= =20 our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio; d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a= nd=20 origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20 align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus; e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent= =20 with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar= e=20 critical to meeting our goals next year.  With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode= ls=20 in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20 being implemented: a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark= et=20 and origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and= =20 Janet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairm= an=20 (EA OOC).

This team = will=20 continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa= le=20 is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex= as=20 gas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20 Financial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n= o=20 significant changes. Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a= nd=20 financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20 specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin= ue to=20 maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and= =20 industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20 mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas= =20 marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred. Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several= =20 distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi= s=20 group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.= =20 This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and= =20 greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include= =20 producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20 relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20 services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20 products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with= =20 Texaco. =20 Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to = Frank=20 Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams. Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t= o=20 Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20  Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi= ed=20 projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20 transportation capacity trading opportunities. =20 There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power= =20 groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=  will=20 coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20 PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering= =20 involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have= =20 asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20 organizations in Houston.=20  e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou= r=20 technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20 ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20 productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th= e=20 Technical Services Group.

This=20 group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and= =20 capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri= sk=20 and monetize.=20  In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a= nd=20 transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and= =20 securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil= l=20 report to the EA OOC.  f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20 opportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by= =20 Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed=20 generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from=20 Enron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the=  EA=20 OOC.  g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20 development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an= d=20 will report to the EA OOC.  h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag= ed by=20 Dave Duran.

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi= ll=20 have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America= . =20 As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating= =20 companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. = =20 If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue = to=20 conduct business in that company.=20  We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20 market.

I'm not really accustomed  to talking business with my friends so let me say right at the beginning that  should you not be interested in the following, no harm, no foul.? The last  thing I want to do is create any discomfort but I really think that this  might be something that you'd be interested in.?  ? First, I'm organizing a show at Lawndale that will open on March 9th in the  Main Gallery called Colorforms.? It's going to include 3 painters - 2 from  Dallas and 1 from New York - and one sculptor - maybe you know her: Jessica  Halonen?? She's a core fellow.? I'm really excited about the show.? I did  studio visits with three of the artists this past weekend and they're all  working on great stuff.? I'm so jazzed about it, that I've been inspired to  write an essay and I haven't written about art in 6 years!Anyway, I'm trying  to do something a little more substantial for the gallery notes - more than  just a folded piece of card stock - and I told Lawndale that I would try and  fund-raise for it.? I'm mentioning this to you only because you have  expressed interest in the past in helping out if I am putting any projects  together.? I'm trying to raise about $250 to cover printing costs.? I'd also  like to have a DJ at the ! opening - maybe Patrick Phipps - but I need to  fund-raise for his fee too.? I know you're thinking \"what about DJ Grils  Baloy\" and I'd like to do it but I'm thinking that I need to circulate  amongst the guests at a show that I organized.?  ? Second, I'm co-chairing Lawndale's Mid-Century Market this year and so I'm  also fund-raising for it.? There is a formal letter/packet that has been put  together but I thought I would ask you a little less formally if you're  interested in supporting the event.? Last year the Market did quite well  based on booth rentals and admission.? This year we're focusing on increasing  the number of donors to the event which has traditionally been small.? There  are several levels of support with varying benefits at each level.? All  proceeds from the event go directly to Lawndale's operating budget. ? As you can tell, I've been increasing my involvement with Lawndale, trying to  help them get through this period of growing pains.?

After leaving your office, I remembered an issue I have had with the Analyst  & Associate Program that might be of interest to you.  During a Texas A&M recruiting meeting, I learned that we have expanded our  list of majors to include computer science.  I wondered why math majors were  not mentioned, and was told that there was not a business need for math  majors.  Like liberal arts majors, they said math majors were only considered  on a person by person basis.  In my opinion, math majors have many of the  same skills as finance majors, and can easily adjust to accounting rotations  as well (I did last summer, and finance majors in the program are forced to  every year.)  I think that Enron is missing out on many qualified candidates  by limiting their recruitment effort.    At Texas A&M the Career Center asks companies for a list of majors they are  targeting, and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the  career center.  I sent my resume to Enron and asked to be included in the  interview process on campus.  However, many other math majors had not heard  of Enron or the other companies, and assumed that there was no place for a  math major at a company like Enron.  Many math majors want to continue their  education, become teachers,  or work for an actuarial firm.  However, many  are undecided.  We are constantly told of the many business possibilities  available to math majors by our teachers and staff, but many undergraduates  are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business  environment.  By not mentioning math majors to the career center (a very  simple and inexpensive step), Enron is losing out on a very talented pool of  people.  While it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about Enron  already, had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math  majors would fit perfectly, and went the extra step to send Enron their  resume outside the career center system, there are many qualified students  who do not do this, and opt for other companies who DID mention math majors.  I called a manager in the A&A program to suggest that we consider at least  mentioning math majors to the career centers.  I realize that it may cost  more to actively pursue them, talk to teachers, and attend math society  events.  However, I told her that including them at the career center would  be very inexpensive for Enron.  She reiterated that they saw no business need  for math majors, and that if more upper level people began requesting them,  it would be considered.  I searched for \"mathematics\" on the Enron job  website, and had a surprising number of results.  I know that your group  could use math majors as well.  However, this still may be too small a number  to merit a focus from the A&A recruiting department.  I just wanted to bring  it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed.

David Port and Arfan are developing the forms. First draft of Customer  Registration form is attached herewith.

Andrew.Wilkinson@cliffordchance.com  Subject: Re: Registration Process Questions    Elena,  Some queries/comments.  1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)  The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept  ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all  other users. The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his  users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders? PA = Password Application, right? Hadn't heard of this until now.   3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get  Trading Access Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer  base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control /  System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we  cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed  off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort,  single point of reference).   Any chance of seeing what format the marketing pack / application is in so  far? We'll need to make sure that the information we're requesting is  comprehensive enough from a systems' perspective.  Thanks,  Bob      Elena Kapralova 07/01/99 10:02 PM To: Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT, Jay Webb/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert  Campbell/LON/ECT@ECT, David Port/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Dilworth/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul  Goddard/LON/ECT@ECT, Justin Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT, Rahil Jafry/LON/ECT@ECT,  Timothy.Hughes@cliffordchance.com. Andrew.Wilkinson@cliffordchance.com cc:   Subject: Registration Process Questions  Last two days showed that there is a big confusion on how exactly the  registration process is going to work. The issue is very important and urgent  as it may cause changes to the scope for Agency.com, and changes in the ETA  and PA documents text.   The registration process appears to differ for different customer groups and,  to my understanding, the latest was agreed as below. Please provide your  comments or any corrections to the following:  1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)  will receive marketing Pack via mail approx. 2 weeks before the system goes  live. The Marketing Pack will include PA (for an appropriate jurisdiction)  and Registration Forms with questions about the customer (name, address,  e-mail, taxable entity etc.)  customers will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron After the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive  IDs and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual  traders in that company The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept  ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all  other users.  Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the  \"House\"?   2. Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users) - Regulators, Lawyers,  Brokers, Potential Traders etc.  will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online, that will be  automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator. Customers will provide  info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address, country of incorporation  etc. If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user, the System Administrator will  e-mail customer Guest ID and Password. When the customer logs in for the  first time as a guest, it'll  have to  accept Read Only ETA on line. Read Only ETA will depend on the guest's place  of incorporation, i.e. the system has to recognise the customer when it logs  in and display an appropriate Read Only ETA. Without accepting Read Only ETA  \"Guest\" user won't be able to view anything in the House.  Q:  1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where?  2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in  session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to  put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all  jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th.  3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform  potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted.  4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back  to Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off  line, but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner  way...  3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get  Trading Access  There are two alternatives possible. Alternative One: Off Line Registration  Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade  online, i.e. get the ID and Password Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for  appropriate jurisdiction Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDs  and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual traders  in that company The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept  ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all  other users.  Alternative Two:  Partial OnLine Registration  Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in  the Garden Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out  appropriate Registration Pack and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and  mail it to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDs  and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual traders  in that company The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept  ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all  other users.  Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2?  2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform  potential customers that there request for Read Only access may not be  granted.  3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC  prefers them to be available...  Regards, Elena                     ", "folder": "online trading"}, {"cleaned_text": "sorry that's Prebon ref number.   The deal is 495120.  Thanks!!

At about 4 p.m. Central time, two senior executives who had attended the meeting, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen, told Mr. Lay about the reaction of employees. ''Ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether,'' Mr. Palmer said. Even if Dynegy's directors later voted to award Mr. Lay a new severance agreement, he would turn it down, Mr. Palmer added.    -----Original Message----- From:  Armstrong, Julie   Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 9:22 AM To: Lohman, TK Subject:   See about traders  11/14/2001 The Wall Street Journal A3 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Enron Corp. said its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has decided to forgo a severance payment of $60.6 million that could be triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of Enron. Mr. Lay's decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice.  Early in the day, an Enron filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission laid out Mr. Lay's severance package. By midday, Enron indicated that Mr. Lay would keep only one-third of the payout, which he would take in stock in the combined company, and that he intended to donate one-third to a foundation to help displaced Enron employees. The remaining third would cover income-tax liabilities. But by the end of the day, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said that Mr. Lay, following a meeting of Enron energy traders, had decided against taking any of the severance pay. Though Mr. Lay didn't attend the traders' meeting, senior managers told him that \"opinions were expressed that he shouldn't receive the payment,\" Mr. Palmer said. \"He decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment.\" The opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of Enron's profits. Questions for Mr. Lay were directed to Mr. Palmer, who said he had spoken with Mr. Lay and other company officials during the day.  The initial disclosure about Mr. Lay's hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell Enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago. Last Friday, Mr. Lay even said that Enron had other options to the Dynegy purchase, which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent, though he declined to elaborate. \"Things weren't desperate . . . we had alternatives,\" Mr. Lay said. The 59-year-old Mr. Lay won't have an executive position at the combined company, though he might be a director.  For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million through the exercise of Enron options, according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial. Last year, Mr. Lay was paid $8.3 million in salary and bonus and more than $10 million in stock awards and other compensation.  Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company's extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers. Those dealings are under investigation by the SEC. Last Friday, Enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller Houston-based Dynegy for stock, currently valued at about $10.7 billion. The merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies.  Separately, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns about three million Enron and 500,000 Dynegy shares, said it would oppose the appointment of any current Enron board member to the board of a combined company. Michael Flaherman, chair of CalPERS investment committee said that it appeared that Enron's board \"failed in its responsibility\" to monitor the activities of Enron executives.  Mr. Palmer, the Enron spokesman, said Mr. Lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward. In February 2000, when Enron stock was trading between $60 and $70 a share and Mr. Lay was being widely lauded for his performance, he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously. Last August, when Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling quit unexpectedly, Mr. Lay assumed Mr. Skilling's duties and his contract term was extended by two years to Dec. 31, 2005.  Under the terms of his contract, Mr. Lay is entitled to payment of $20.2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract, in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control. Thus, Mr. Lay is entitled to three full years of payments, or $60.6 million.  Mr. Lay, who took charge of the then-Houston Natural Gas Co. in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company, wasn't the only member of his family to benefit from Enron's heady rise to a global energy giant. SEC filings show that in recent years a sister of Mr. Lay, Sharon Lay, and a son, Mark Lay, received millions of dollars in salary, commissions and bonuses related to Ms. Lay's travel agency and a paper-products company connected to the younger Mr. Lay.  Mr. Palmer said it is a \"cheap shot\" to criticize the Lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements. \"The contracts were bid out and fairly awarded,\" Mr. Palmer said. Ms. Lay said her travel agency, of which she is president and half-owner, had won its Enron business through competitive bidding and by providing \"the very best service possible.\" Mark Lay couldn't be reached for comment.  Coming on top of disclosures of Enron's dealings with partnerships run by its own executives, the relationships between Lay family members and the company again raise questions about Enron's willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests. Former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and possibly other Enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships.  Mark Lay's dealings with Enron date back to 1994, according to the available SEC filings. In May 1997, Mark Lay and \"certain other individuals\" who together had been officers, directors or shareholders of a company called Paper & Print Management Corp., or PPMC, entered into employment agreements with an Enron unit, Enron Capital & Trade Resources, according to Enron's 1998 proxy statement. The individuals helped set up \"a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products,\" according to the SEC filing. Mr. Palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of Enron's profitable paper and pulp-trading business.  As part of the deal, Enron agreed to reimburse PPMC $1 million for certain expenses. Mark Lay and his colleagues also agreed to \"convey\" to Enron \"certain intangible property rights\" from PPMC.  Mark Lay also got a three-year employment contract from Enron as a vice president of Enron Capital & Trade. He got a signing bonus of $100,000, a minimum monthly salary of $12,500, a minimum annual bonus of $100,000 for 1997-1999 and an option to purchase 20,000 Enron shares. Mark Lay is no longer with Enron and is now attending a seminary, said Mr. Palmer.  Since 1985, Sharon Lay's firm, Lay/Wittenberg Travel Agency in the Park Inc., has provided travel arrangements for employees of Enron and its predecessor company. For this work the agency received $6.8 million from 1996 through 2000. In an interview yesterday, Ms. Lay said Enron accounted for more than half of her firm's revenue in some years. She said her brother's position was \"more a problem\" than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn't worked hard enough to get Enron's business.", "folder": "corp"}, {"cleaned_text": "I have changed the following deals to PPT 534074 534072 534071   Thanks!!", "folder": "deal discrepancies"}, {"cleaned_text": "Hi Vince.

Yesterday I  extended the deal 421415 for the 6th and 19th and Meredith inserted a path in  Unify - TETCO  to cover the small overflow volume between HPL and ENA. The  ENA/HPL piece is done.

The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial  counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow. 2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note  below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility  counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal  regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters  in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of  negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the  relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot  approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company  websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility  or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due  diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or  federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only  make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me. 3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a  regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website  what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that  Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway. 4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel,  unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to  enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws  specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this  until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say \"no\" for  Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with. 5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an  eligible swap participant (or \"ESP\").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives  trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain  financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies,  banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth  and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say  \"not ESP\" or \"not eligible swap participant\" it means they have not met the  financial net worth test. 6.  The American Coal Company.

If we have already satisfactorily concluded  the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will  be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet  been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required  involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their  organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant  state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there  and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular  utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the  utility's counsel.  We usually begin that process only when a trader believes  there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to  justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past  revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives  or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.  A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to  40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.

An Enron Director or  above {With Signature Authority to legally bind Enron to a contract} will  have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be  installed. Delivery times on new machines are normally 3-5 working days but  either Vendor listed below will be able to provide a \"Loaner\" should you have  a business need. Please discuss the Fax Machine Install Date with the Rep  when ordering the equipment.  If there is no existing fax line present, you will need to send a Notes-Mail  to the Move Team {Erica @ x3-3185 or Janelle @ x5-7917} requesting the  installation of a new fax line. The Move Team can be found in the Notes-Mail  \"ECT Address Book\".  If you are an EES employee, you must first get new equipment approval from  EES Budget Control. Contact Susan McLeroy @ x5-8066 or via Notes-Mail.  If you are an EBS employee, you must first get new equipment approval from  EBS Purchasing & Budget Control. Contact Paula Corey @ x3-9948 or Martha  Reyna @ x3-3491. You can reach both of these people via Notes-Mail.  If you are an ENA employee, you must first get new equipment approval from  ENA Finance & Budget Control. Contact Lorie Belsha @ x3-9617 or via  Notes-Mail.   A note on the fax machines listed below: All the machines listed below come with a 2nd paper tray and Upgraded memory  {Maxed by model~See Below} as an Enron Standard from each Vendor. All the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated @ 33.6 Kbps versus  the Canon LaserClass 7500 {Example only} @ 14.4 Kbps = New fax machine should  be noticeably quicker. Document feeder capacity of the machines listed below are the same as the  Canon LaserClass 7500             {Example only} Maintenance = Models listed below have Maintenance/Repair coverage included  in monthly $ total. There is NO separate agreement! Toner/Drum cartridges +  paper + line charges are extra {Not quoted}  Contract pricing can change without warning, so please let me know ASAP if a  Vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various  models.  If the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment, here are some  considerations: No more than 20 people per fax machine = Take a look @ the fax machine  placement on EB30 or EB31. Disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33.6K Modem and JBIG  compression {or equivalent}. Look for memory upgrades & 2nd paper tray included in monthly cost. {Models  quoted are loaded}. Maintenance is to be INCLUDED in Monthly Cost {Models quoted are covered}.   *********************  From Pitney Bowes   PB2050   COST: $95.00 per month on RENTAL Enron Specs: This model has 10megs of memory + a 2nd paper tray as standard.

Q) How many people will be using this fax machine? Q) How much usage will this fax machine have?  {i.e. Heavy = 40 faxes per day @ 20 pages/60 faxes per day @ 2-3 pages or a  lot less? If \"HEAVY\", either the PB2050, PB9930 or  UF885/UF895 should fit  your needs = If 15-40, the PB9830 would probably be a better fit}  ********************* CONTRACT DETAILS      The Fax programs are an agreement between each end user of the fax machine  and the relevant Vendor, as follows:  Pitney Bowes 36 month RENTAL. 30 day notice for termination of contract. No Penalty for early Termination of contract = Call PB Rep. and have the  machine picked up, making sure a receipt is given to you by the collecting  Rep. Upgrade/Downgrade available = $0 penalty.

The User or Requester of the Fax machine is responsible for invoice payment.  Enron Property & Services Corporation is NOT responsible for the coding,  processing or payment of Facsimile {FAX} machine invoices.  In order to return any old fax machine equipment, you must contact the  leasing company that supplied the equipment and send them a certified letter  that terminates the agreement. If you terminate a contract within the  original agreement period, you may be liable for penalty charges as a lot of  Fax Machines are on a non-cancellable lease agreement. The Vendor who  supplied the fax equipment will be able to let you know of any outstanding $  amounts for your existing equipment.   If you are asked to pay outstanding $ amounts, be aware that some Vendors  include the cost of outright PURCHASE of the old fax equipment = From the  contracts I have reviewed so far, you are under NO obligation to purchase the  old equipment.

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).  National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.  Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.  When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected:  1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it.  2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage.  ** IMPORTANT *** These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974) To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.  First, let's take a look at the survey results.  In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.  I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:  1. Stock price 2. The PRC 3. Employee/internal morale 4. External reputation and image 5. \"Walking the talk\" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________  II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.    % of employees responding  strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron. 64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in. 60.1% I am treated with respect. 60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family. 59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing. 54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks. 47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there. 46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there. 41.6%  _________________________________________________________________________________________  III.

Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.  1. People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): --- talented --- creative ---     learn from one another 2. Culture and reputation: --- innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3. Work environment: --- pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities  _________________________________________________________________________________________  The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.  Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.  STOCK PRICE  We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: --- A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A \"meltdown\" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.  These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.  --- Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. --- We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: --- Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.  THE PRC  The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.  Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: --- Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.  In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.  EMPLOYEE MORALE  We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. --- We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. --- We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. --- Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.  EXTERNAL REPUTATION  We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: --- We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.  INTEGRITY & RESPECT  I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. --- Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. --- We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.  Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "Instructions for Life in the new millennium from > > > > >the Dalai Lama: > > > > >1.

However,  starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west  using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less  are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing  else on a letter requiring a signature.

Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.  First, let's take a look at the survey results.  In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.  I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:  1. Stock price 2. The PRC 3. Employee/internal morale 4. External reputation and image 5. \"Walking the talk\" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________  II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.    % of employees responding  strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron. 64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in. 60.1% I am treated with respect. 60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family. 59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing. 54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks. 47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there. 46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there. 41.6%  _________________________________________________________________________________________  III.

Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.  1. People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): --- talented --- creative ---     learn from one another 2. Culture and reputation: --- innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3. Work environment: --- pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities  _________________________________________________________________________________________  The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.  Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.  STOCK PRICE  We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: --- A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A \"meltdown\" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.  These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.  --- Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. --- We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: --- Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.  THE PRC  The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.  Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: --- Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.  In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.  EMPLOYEE MORALE  We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. --- We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. --- We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. --- Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.  EXTERNAL REPUTATION  We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: --- We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.  INTEGRITY & RESPECT  I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. --- Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. --- We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.  Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.", "folder": "corp"}, {"cleaned_text": "I am pleased to announce that Brian Heinrich will be joining the Strategic  Operations group effective March 1.

From my understanding, the allocation for meter 785: State Tract 121  is supplied from Bryancy Braumley.  Prior to 09/1/00 Bryancy would calculate  flow from certain wellheads, total this volume, and then send us an  allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to Texas General Land  and HPL (Sale from CLECO) at meter 785.  Effective 09/1/00 a compressor was  put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor, as well as the  gas from meter 9662 (Deal 137595 Sales from Dewbre), and is now measured at  meter 3527:Tivoli Station.  For Bryancy's allocation, she must take the meter  statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662's flow.  Once this is done,  she can take that net number and do an allocation between Texas General Land  and HPL (CLECO) like she has done previously.  I believe meter 785 is now a  check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter.   For 9/00 there were two deals in place for the sale from CLECO, deal 397957  and 449243.  Per discussions with Daren Farmer, Danny Conner, and Jennifer  Martinez, I have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use  449243 as the correct deal number.  Therefore, Fred Boas and I have zeroed  out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal  449243.  Deal 397957 was priced at ship less .18 which was incorrect and deal  449243 is priced at ship less .15.  Therefore, an adjustment will generate  for 9/00 for the difference in price and the change in location.  The  allocated volume for CLECO did not change.  However, I am not sure that  Bryancy is allocating the volume properly between Texas General Land and HPL  (CLECO).  I have spoke to her, as well as Jennifer Martinez, and Curtis  Funderbruk with CLECO so there might be some PMA's for volume differences.   In addition, I have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a  callout\\swing effect 9/00.  For October and succeeding months, the volume  should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662.  Then  Byancy should take this net number and split it between Texas General Land  and HPL (CLECO).  The Texas General Land nom is currently at meter 785 and  the HPL (Cleco) deal is at meter 3527.  Fred mentioned that the Texas General  Land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on  that yet.     Please let me know if something I have stated is not your understanding or  you need something more done on my end.  Also, let me know who is going to be  doing this monthly allocation.  It might be beneficial to have one person  doing all the points (meters 3527, 9662, 785).  Thanks for your help!!!

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated -- time and  time again -- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight  years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral  College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last  line of defense?   Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities.   The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's  \"Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech.\" While he was extolling the  virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida -- from Bill Daley to  Jesse Jackson -- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al  Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the  fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work.   But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me -- a darker, more  sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am  overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a  difficult task.   Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the  Constitution.   The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I  mean?   Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with  certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The  president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of  the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to  the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these  United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards.   \"Oh, Farah,\" you say, \"you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results  in any way with the whole world watching, do you?\"   Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last  several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria  stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted.   They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but  accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud.   Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: \"More than 100 million Americans voted  on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it  also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they  were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is to  prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next  president of the United States.\"   They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins.   Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for  certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the  majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a  thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet.  Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition  team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to  sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be a  fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bush  campaign's playbook.   The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the  challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. Too  many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional  authority -- Vice President Al Gore.   Would you put it past him? I sure wouldn't.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --  Joseph Farah is editor and chief executive officer of WorldNetDaily.com and  writes a daily column.

Previously, the rules simply required creation of a firewall, including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel, between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates. The proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate, gas or electric, including financial affiliates.  The Commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates, which still in many cases have bundled operations. One option would enforce complete separation, while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load. Staff and Commissioners Wood, William Massey and Nora Brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel, so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non-affiliated competitors did not have access to.  Commissioner Linda Breathitt, however, argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load. Breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities, she was concerned about the timing. \"I see no compelling reason at this time; there have been no complaints and no evidence.\" She said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction. \"I agree with concept philosophically, but I think there will be other opportunities later on, after we do a little more bridge-building with state commissions.\"  Wood said he understood \"the political issue here with respect to federal-state relations, but I think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated.\" Staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems, waivers could be granted. Staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel. \"If I am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load, I can go into the control room and get all the information I want,\" one staffer responded.  Wood proposed, and the commissioners ratified, a proposed rule with no exceptions, but which makes clear that in the final rule the Commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required. Commenting parties should provide cost/benefit analysis on both sides of the question. State commissions are also invited to comment. Wood had suggested the Commission extend the separation to all sales employees, \"but make it clear that if we don't hear from people that they really want this separation, we ain't going to do it.\" ", "folder": "logistics"}, {"cleaned_text": "As you are aware, the Corporate American Express credit cards have been cancelled, effective December 4, 2001.

Culture and reputation: --- innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3. Work environment: --- pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities  _________________________________________________________________________________________  The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.  Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.  STOCK PRICE  We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: --- A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A \"meltdown\" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.  These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.  --- Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. --- We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: --- Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.  THE PRC  The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.  Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: --- Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.  In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.  EMPLOYEE MORALE  We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. --- We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. --- We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. --- Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.  EXTERNAL REPUTATION  We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: --- We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.  INTEGRITY & RESPECT  I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. --- Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. --- We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.  Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.", "folder": "corp"}, {"cleaned_text": "Zimin,  Please, take a look at it.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk  groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing,  structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and  back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these  services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice  President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the  Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will  continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice  President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the  Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim  Belden.

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.  Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows:   1. Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.     2. You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766.  3. You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.    This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.    If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total  car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing  provisions (i.e. insurance).  National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value  proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first  choice for Enron travelers' needs.  Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract  reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and  low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National,  where available.  When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or  Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate  selected:  1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or  Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for  any damage to it.  2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle.  For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000  per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage.  ** IMPORTANT *** These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following  contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded  on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)  To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's  preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in  National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club  membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the  transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid  return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron  travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron  American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on  the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left  unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed  appropriately.  Someone   needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero,  that were nominated for January.  Resolved but needs to be verified.   2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This  issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot  allocate was is   not pathed and nominated.  Unresolved or Unpathed?   3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point  specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203  10,000).  This is a pathed pipeline. We have no rate.

This can wait until we get back  next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return.  I haven't had time to do this yet.

As you can see, I am now working for the FT's magazine publishing business; I have responsibility for what's currently  termed the Expatriate Division and I've just passed my statutory probationary period of 3 months. Apologies for not contacting you sooner - but I guess you knew you'd hear from me sooner or later , especially when I need help! Having  gotten thru probation, I am set loose upon new projects......I'm investigating  several ideas for new magazine product and wondered if you would be able to comment on one of them.  Very basically, I want to develop a magazine product for the international private investor, specifically o HNWIs o Owner-managers o Results-oriented but intelligent investor with long-term investment goals  and a desire to be able to converse with their private bankers and/or brokers on something approaching equal terms  The product would be delivered monthly and cater to the developing breed of private international investor who prefers to make informed decisions - for themselves. The product would aim to cover the major asset classes, including the \"wilder shores\" such as Hedge Funds and Emerging Markets. I am working on  a portal site (imaginatively entitled FTEXPAT.COM!), nested within FT.com, which will launch in October; International Investment will be a significant channel on the site, and a key distribution/marketing channel for this (and future) offering. At this very early stage I am testing out the reaction to the notion of such a product - do you have one? Would you be able to suggest any other contacts who might be willing/able to share their thoughts with me? I know  it's not bang in your sphere but I'm hoping you'll be interested enough to share your thoughts with me.  If you can give me a few pointers, I'd be grateful.

Saturday 3/24 - 7:30 am, received page from Lee in Gas Control regarding the  Gulf Plains Plant, apparently they felt that they may need to overdeliver for  Saturday's gas day as well.  Phoned Larry Zammit and spoke with him regarding  the situation at the plant, he indicated that there may have been a  miscommunication or misunderstanding at the plant.  Larry phoned the plant  and made sure that they were on board to keep us balanced and not overdeliver  to,  or swing on, HPL.   2:00 pm - Phoned Lee in Gas Control to see how the pipeline was doing.  He  indicated that we were pretty tight, but would probably make it without  utilizing any OBA's.  Sunday - So. Union requested 15M beginning at 11:00 am.

Growing evidence, the newest of which will appear today in the journal Nature Genetics, is giving medical researchers the answer to this \"why\" question, which in turn should enhance their ability to devise effective therapies.  Baylor College of Medicine researchers will report perhaps the strongest evidence yet supporting a theory that excess RNA, the molecule that spurs production of proteins in the body, can effectively clog cells and lead to muscle weakness and other ailments.  \"The more you know, and the better you understand how things work, the smarter you'll be when developing drugs,\" said one of the study's three authors, Dr. Thomas A. Cooper, a Baylor associate professor of pathology.  Cooper and his Baylor colleagues, Drs. Rajesh S. Savkur and Anne V. Philips, are studying patients with myotonic dystrophy whose faulty insulin receptors do not process enough blood sugar for their muscles to work properly.  The disease is particularly devastating, Cooper said, because it runs in families, often getting worse with each subsequent generation. Afflicting about 30,000 Americans, myotonic dystrophy worsens over time, weakening muscles, causing cataracts and even mental retardation.  \"It's a very unfair disease to families,\" he said.  The mutated gene of those with myotonic dystrophy makes too many copies of RNA, which, in turn, produce the wrong types of proteins that muscles need to process blood sugar.  The genes of healthy people have only a few excess RNA copies, always less than three dozen. Patients with moderate forms of myotonic dystrophy have hundreds of copies, and the most severe forms of the disease, sometimes seen in children, can have thousands of copies.  Now scientists will know where to look for better treatments -- such as dissolving the globs of RNA -- and in places they did not consider before.  \"This is a big step forward,\" said Dr. Sharon Hesterlee, director of research development for the Tucson, Ariz.-based Muscular Dystrophy Association, which helped fund the study. \"The pieces of this disease's puzzle are really beginning to fall into place. It gives us a much better idea of what to target for therapies.\"  Hesterlee said Cooper's work is consistent with research published in another journal last month also supporting the theory that RNA blockages are causing most of the symptoms of myotonic dystrophy.  Cooper said the next step for researchers, having identified RNA as the culprit, is to understand precisely why the excess RNA is botching efforts by the body's cells to produce the correct proteins allowing muscles to act as they should. That will provide more effective, targeted therapies, he said. ", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "It's time to kick-off Enron's 2000 United Way Campaign!

Lana Steffen Administrative Analyst Liberal, KS=20    Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling 03/13/2001 04:17 PM   Sent by: Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling To: All Enron Worldwide cc: =20  Subject: California Energy Crisis  California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve= ral=20 months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We= =20 want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=  =20 Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation= =20 and our position on California energy issues.  What happened in California  The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp= ly=20 and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr= eased=20 the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20 restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So= =20 demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul= t,=20 predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.  In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related= =20 factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations= =20 forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for= =20 power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market= =20 when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo= ng=20 term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I= n=20 California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20 equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th= e=20 most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20 while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat= t=20 was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.  Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain= ed=20 in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20 competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa= le=20 prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20 regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.  In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat= ion. =20 Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new= =20 generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile= =20 spot prices.  At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned= =20 the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w= hich,=20 if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.  Enron=01,s Role  Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f= ix=20 the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20 politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:  ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the= =20 state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the= =20 same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20 market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar= e=20 interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc= ts=20 for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from= =20 the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We= =20 protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.  You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20 power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on= =20 the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=  of our=20 customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:  ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20 market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct= ly=20 from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20 allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue = to=20 receive the financial benefits of their contract prices. ? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them= =20 with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20 reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.  Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its= =20 crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20 continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western= =20 power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom= ers=20 with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more= =20 demand for our products and services.  The Solution  The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary= , the=20 state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark= et=20 and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.  Increasing Supply  California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing= =20 short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les= s=20 than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl= y=20 must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20 generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the= =20 regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20 displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can= =20 have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20 facilities.  Reducing Demand  Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. = =20 They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail= =20 market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman= d=20 at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market= .  Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market  In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20 volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer= =20 term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han= ds=20 of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market= . =20 Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the= ir=20 price risk.  Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions  The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20 greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to= =20 arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov= er=20 their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and= =20 distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is= =20 needed.  Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that= ,=20 while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters= =20 worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work= ed;=20 and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages= ,=20 which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20 ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether = it=20 is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall= ey=20 or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20 shortage worse.  The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20 California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that= =20 the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20 constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in= =20 California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20 generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road= s=20 and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.  As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t= he=20 crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=  will=20 continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20 solutions to the state. =20   ", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": "Cute!  -----Original Message----- From: Mark J.

In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a= =20 number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The= =20 goals of such re-alignment include: a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe= e=20 is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set; b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation= =20 with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal= =20 flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to= =20 our trading organization; c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate= =20 our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase= =20 our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio; d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a= nd=20 origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20 align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus; e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent= =20 with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar= e=20 critical to meeting our goals next year.  With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode= ls=20 in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20 being implemented: a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark= et=20 and origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and= =20 Janet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairm= an=20 (EA OOC).  This team will have one income statement, one book and a joint= =20 accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the= se=20 teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage= =20 the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the=20 partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera= te=20 origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,= =20 provide information and generate strategic positions.  Overall, the team wi= ll=20 be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting=20 coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the=20 Eastern power markets. The team will be responsible for covering the IOU=01= ,s,=20 muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials and IPP=01,s and will utilize all ENA=01,s pr= oduct=20 capabilities including the power commodity, assets and capital. The team wi= ll=20 further be broken down into several key strategic regions and business unit= s=20 including:=20   (i) ERCOT =01) managed by Doug Gilbert Smith and Bruce Sukaly;   (ii) NE =01) managed by Dana Davis and Jeff Ader;   (iii) Midwest =01) managed by Fletch Sturm and Ed Baughman;   (iv) SE =01) managed by Rogers Herndon and Ozzie Pagan;   (v) East Power Development =01) managed by Ben Jacoby;   (vi) East Power Structuring  - managed by Bernie Aucoin; and   (vii) East Power Fundamentals and the =01&Genco=018 =01) managed by Lloyd=  Will   =20 b) West Power =01) there will be no changes to the Portland office which is= =20 managed by Tim Belden and Chris Calger .  Both Tim and Chris will continue = to=20 report to the EA OOC. c) Canada and Mexico =01) there will be no changes to the Canadian or Mexic= an=20 offices which are managed by Rob Milnthorp and Max Yzaguirre respectively. = =20 Both Rob and Max will continue to report to the EA OOC. d) U.S. Natural Gas =01) there are several changes anticipated in this busi= ness=20 consistent with the goals and objectives described above. The changes=20 primarily affect the East, Central, West and Texas gas regions. Each region= =20 will consist of a single gas team incorporating trading, mid-market and=20 origination. Each team will have one income statement, one book and a joint= =20 accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the= se=20 teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage= =20 the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the=20 partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera= te=20 origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,= =20 provide information and generate strategic positions. Overall, the team wil= l=20 be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting=20 coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the=20 Eastern, Western, Central and Texas gas markets.  The team will be=20 responsible for covering the LDC=01,s, muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU= =01,s, IPP=01,s=20 and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side = of=20 the business including the producers, transporters and storage providers in= =20 addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,= s=20 product capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each = of=20 these groups will report directly to the EA OOC; East Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and= =20 origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Scott Neal and Frank= =20 Vickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team. =20 West Gas  =01) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-manag= ed by=20 Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th= e=20 Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under= =20 this team. Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20 co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20 integrated into this team. Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team = will=20 continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa= le=20 is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex= as=20 gas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20 Financial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n= o=20 significant changes. Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a= nd=20 financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20 specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin= ue to=20 maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and= =20 industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20 mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas= =20 marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred. Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several= =20 distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi= s=20 group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.= =20 This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and= =20 greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include= =20 producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20 relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20 services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20 products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with= =20 Texaco. =20 Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to = Frank=20 Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams. Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t= o=20 Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20  Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi= ed=20 projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20 transportation capacity trading opportunities. =20 There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power= =20 groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=  will=20 coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20 PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering= =20 involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have= =20 asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20 organizations in Houston.=20  e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou= r=20 technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20 ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20 productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th= e=20 Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks = and=20 will provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA=20 organization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In= =20 addition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will= =20 report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portio= n=20 of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This=20 group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and= =20 capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri= sk=20 and monetize.=20  In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a= nd=20 transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and= =20 securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil= l=20 report to the EA OOC.  f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20 opportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by= =20 Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed=20 generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from=20 Enron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the=  EA=20 OOC.  g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20 development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an= d=20 will report to the EA OOC.  h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag= ed by=20 Dave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.  i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20 currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20 continue to report to the EA OOC.  As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi= ll=20 have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America= . =20 As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating= =20 companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. = =20 If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue = to=20 conduct business in that company.=20  We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20 market.  This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the= =20 most talented employees.  The opportunities are endless.

Assume we are in the new building and we have technical problems that force us out of the building either due to IT connection issues or problems with the building itself (AC, power, etc.).

Obviously space is limited so what we will do is only bring the people that need to be in the building to get noms out and send the others home to handle business remotely. One approach is to take the EDI pipes and have them go to the 30th floor to ensure they have the support and quicker system then if they did their noms from home.

Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return  on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction  projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary  focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following  organizational changes concerning EECC:  EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of  Enron Transportation Services.   NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant  construction services to Enron entities and third parties. The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the  EES Office of the Chairman.

PG&E did not have the right to do that, so they are going to allocate that  volume to Comstock, from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month  index.  At the same time PG&E will create an imbalance, for which they will  pay HPL the same amount HPL paid them for the gas for those two days.  This  should wash the sale at Gas Daily and leave HPL buying the gas at the  beginning of the month IFHSC ( the price in the Comstock purchase contract)  and selling it at the Gas Daily price for 12/12 and 12/13.

However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentially having been on such a round table discussion.  I've been teaching a \"real options\" course that has the students performing monte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing along with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of your new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course. However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is particularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about option pricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.  This is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talented themselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you and/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you recommend that he do to get his foot in the door?  His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.  His name is George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a potential employee.  I am making an exception in this case because he is a particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant.  Otherwise, I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling too much.  Tom Professor Tom Arnold E.J.

I just wanted to touch base and see if I needed to snail mail  a copy of my  resume or get in touch with anyone else over at Enron.?   ? The finance department at LSU will be sending out financial  award letters to  new Ph.D. students before long, and my interning at Enron would  free up some  additional departmental funds.? In addition, If I will be here  in Baton  Rouge during the fall, I will need to pay my tuition next month.?  I am able  to pursue an internship in large part because of the department's   cooperation and assurance that when I return I will still have a research and  or  teaching assistantship to help fund the completion of Ph.D.? I have been   told that such cooperation and assurances are rare at LSU, so I am trying to   rock the boat as little as possible. ? I realize until I receive an offer from Enron my internship (I  say  internship rather than sabbatical because LSU will not continue to pay me my   stipend while I am away) is not assured until an offer has been extended by   Enron.? I understand that there are procedures?and protocols that must  be  followed before this occurs, and I would be willing to do whatever is   necessary to move to the next step in that process. ?

Starting today, please implement the following business information retention policies:  (1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded, etc. at will.  (2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.  (3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS: do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.  (4) DATABASES: do not delete any information in DATABASES.

The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.  First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.  The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.  Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.    As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.  In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.  We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.  Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Moreover,the $ 90,000 may be paid in 3 fractions and your risk would be quite minimal 3.Regarding the escrow,we have been using so far a small law firm with 5 partners(none of my family) in Amherst:Hart,Reed,Brown,Golowich and Kaplan.But we are not closed to anther solution you would strongly prefer.

Be Among the First to Participate: Enrollment with NewPower begins March 12.  Also, watch for a special Enron Employees Exclusive offer on your desk March 12.

The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:  ? Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.    ? After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.  ? The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.    To move funds: On the Web, choose \"Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation\" from the drop down menu. On Voice Response, choose \"request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.\" This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

We= =20 want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=  =20 Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation= =20 and our position on California energy issues.  What happened in California  The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp= ly=20 and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr= eased=20 the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20 restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So= =20 demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul= t,=20 predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.  In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related= =20 factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations= =20 forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for= =20 power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market= =20 when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo= ng=20 term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I= n=20 California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20 equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th= e=20 most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20 while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat= t=20 was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.  Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain= ed=20 in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20 competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa= le=20 prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20 regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.  In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat= ion. =20 Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new= =20 generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile= =20 spot prices.  At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned= =20 the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w= hich,=20 if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.  Enron=01,s Role  Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f= ix=20 the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20 politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:  ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the= =20 state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the= =20 same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20 market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar= e=20 interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc= ts=20 for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from= =20 the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We= =20 protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.  You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20 power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on= =20 the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=  of our=20 customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:  ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20 market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct= ly=20 from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20 allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue = to=20 receive the financial benefits of their contract prices. ? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them= =20 with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20 reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.  Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its= =20 crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20 continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western= =20 power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom= ers=20 with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more= =20 demand for our products and services.  The Solution  The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary= , the=20 state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark= et=20 and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.  Increasing Supply  California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing= =20 short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les= s=20 than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl= y=20 must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20 generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the= =20 regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20 displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can= =20 have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20 facilities.  Reducing Demand  Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. = =20 They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail= =20 market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman= d=20 at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market= .  Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market  In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20 volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer= =20 term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han= ds=20 of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market= . =20 Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the= ir=20 price risk.  Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions  The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20 greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to= =20 arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov= er=20 their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and= =20 distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is= =20 needed.  Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that= ,=20 while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters= =20 worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work= ed;=20 and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages= ,=20 which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20 ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether = it=20 is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall= ey=20 or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20 shortage worse.  The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20 California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that= =20 the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20 constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in= =20 California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20 generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road= s=20 and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

There is  one related contractual issue I have not been able resolve. As it is not an  issue at peculiar to Australia I would appreciate your input. My apologies in  advance if I am covering well trodden ground.   It is settled that a counterparty will enter into one Password Agreement and  one ETA. There will be a principal Enron contracting party for the PA and  ETA, which I will refer to as the  \"Enron Principal\" . However the definition  of \"Enron\"in both documents also includes other Enron affiliates. In this way  the Enron Principal enters into the PA and the ETA as an agent for any  affiliate that may at some stage enter into an EnronOnline Transaction with  that counterparty. This means the relevant Enron affiliate could enforce the  terms of the PA and ETA . This is in addition to the rights of the Enron  Principal to enforce the ETA and PA. But what happens if the Enron affiliate  is not in existence (i.e. has not been incorporated)  at the time the PA is  signed and the ETA is  accepted by the counterparty? It is settled law in  Australia and I believe in England that you cannot be a party to a contract  if you don't exist.    What does this mean? Well in most instances not much. If it was a question   of enforcement of the contractual terms of the ETA or the PA the Enron  Principal could seek the relevant remedy such as an injunction or specific  performance. But procedural problems in litigation could arise if a newly  incorporated Enron company suffered damage through a breach by a counterparty  of the ETA. For example a breach of the indemnity in clause 4. The Enron  Principal could not sue for damages as it would have suffered none.   Whilst not a major issue it may be prudent to ensure EnronOnline procedures  recognise the particular circumstances that arise when introducing a newly  incorporated Enron entities as contracting parties through EnronOnline.  ", "folder": "online trading"}, {"cleaned_text": "Mark, following on from my note a few minutes ago I refer to point 2(b) in  Janine's note below. Edmund.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Edmund Cooper/LON/ECT on 07/14/99 03:56  PM ---------------------------   Janine Juggins 07/13/99 07:53 PM To: David Port/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Edmund Cooper/LON/ECT@ECT, Stephen H Douglas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Louise  Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Business process language  1. On line payee tax representation issues  The final generic payee tax representation language is being sent through by  Slaughter & May (tonight) and will be incorporated into the Generic Financial  GTC.   As we discussed earlier the approach taken will require two additional fields  in our Financial Confirmations. Since we are continuing to prepare these  written Financial confirmations the normal back office procedures will apply  to their issuance, and thus this requirement should not have any direct  impact on the on line systems. It does however introduce a requirement to  make a change to the confirmation templates which needs to be in place ready  for the first on line transactions in September. I believe there are  different templates in use for the different Financial businesses.  I suggest that the two new fields required in the Financial Confirmations are  included under the section outlining the general terms of the swap.These will  take the form of:  Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction: <<Insert country of incorporation of the  Counterparty>>  Counterparty Payee Jurisdiction(s): 1. <<Insert country in which the trading  office through which the Counterparty transacts is located>>           2. <<If different to 1, insert country in which the office through  which the Counterparty will make payment is located>>  Once new customers are established (and also for existing customer base -  would this be a good way of approaching dealing with the existing customer  base with the aim of eliminating Annex A which are different only because of  the tax reps ?) perhaps a good way of maintaining this data would be to set  it up on a spreadsheet [or the counterparty database ?] [direct link from the  New Customer Registration Form]. Thus the decision on which countries to  insert would only need to be made once on setting up a new counterparty. For  example the spreadsheet could look like this:  Counterparty Description   Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction  Counterparty  Payee Jurisdiction 1     Counterparty Payee Juris 2  Morgan Stanley Singapore Pte Ltd  Singapore    Singapore    Morgan Stanley London branch   US     UK Morgan Stanley Paris branch   US     France  There will also need to be a clear statement on the Financial Confirmation  that it is the Counterparty's responsibility to notify Enron where the  Counterparty Payor or Payee Jurisdiction information is incorrect. This is  particularly important for the tax representations as Enron is using its  judgement to identify the relevant countries but this may not always be  correct (sometimes the place of management of the business is the relevant  factor and Enron is not in a position to know this). This actually is no  different to the situation we have today when it is Enron which determines  which variety of the Annex A gets sent out.  2. New Customer Registration Form  a) Please add an additional question under Legal Information required:  Country from which payment is to be made if different:     _____________________  b) The following has not yet been agreed by Steve Douglas but I wanted to  raise the subject to get comments on the issue of European counterparties  trading financials directly with US Enron entities.  Statement to be added under the heading of Tax Information Required (US new  customer registration form only):   Please submit to [ECTRC] IRS Form W9 and IRS Form 1001, or IRS Form W8 and  IRS Form 4224 (as applicable), indicating the authority under which payments  to be made to you are not subject to US Federal Income Tax withholding.  Since this statement is not required for ECTRI European counterparties this  leads to a New Counterparty Registration Form for US counterparties and a  separate New Counterparty Registration Form for European counterparties - is  this an issue ?   Also is it the intention to give to European counterparties the ability to  trade financial products which would be contracted for by US Enron entities  eg Pulp Financials and Plastics etc - in this case, it would make commercial  sense to send the European counterparty the correct IRS Forms in order to  eliminate this as an obstacle to the registration process [I have also asked  Edmund to confirm whether we would want to avoid European counterparties  contracting financials directly with US Enron entities for European financial  regulatory reasons].  3. Business Process  You asked for some language to include in the Business Process to describe  this procedure. Here's my suggestion:  \" Tax Representations  The responses to the 3 Legal Information Requirements set out on the New  Customer Registration Form [will link directly to the Counterparty Payor  Jurisdiction and the Counterparty Payee Jurisdiction fields on the relevant  Financial confirmation] or [should be entered into the counterparty database]  or [should be entered into the spreadsheet for maintaing tax representation  data]. The response to question 1 is the Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction, the  responses to questions 2 and 3 (if any) are the Counterparty Payee  Jurisdiction(s).  Tax Department should review the New Customer Registration forms periodically  [frequency ? daily ? weekly ? currently we do this every time a new  counterparty is set up, but we do not want to introduce unnecessary delays to  the registration process when there is a window of time to make an adjustment  to the database/other medium feeding into the confirms before the first trade  has been done] to identify obvious inconsistencies in the responses [the onus  is on the customer to identify errors, but we should probably act in good  faith in assisting to identify obvious errors].\"  Sorry this is so long  Regards Janine ", "folder": "online trading"}, {"cleaned_text": "This message is to inform you that information contained on your printed pa= y=20 advice for the pay period ending May 31, 2001, may be misleading.

It was  edi'd over to POPS from the 25th through the 31st populating all days with  the 16,700 nom.  The nom was never -0- out in POPS therefore the change  notification process in POPS did not pick up a change at this meter.  This  meter is pathed by Kim and confirmed by me - it is extremely odd that this  was missed in MOPS.  The record would have been out of balance and someone,  if not several people, normally would make a comment on this.   Also  -  all  of my records indicate that the 16,700 was good through the 31st except the  MOPS entry.  My confirmations with Koch didn't reflect the -0- ;  the last  report I have from Koch indicated the 16,700 stayed on, there was no record  of a phone call indicating anything other than 16,700.  It is very odd for  this many checks and balances to fail.  Also, the volumes were being sent  back to MOPS which no one caught.     I have spoken with Koch today and they agree that the 16,700 should have gone  to -0- therefore I have removed the nom from POPS confirmed volumes and  re-allocated the meter.  The OBA has taken the hit and I am working off the  imbalance now.  Daren, I am sorry that you had to look into this when you feel this is my  responsibility.  Stella was trying to help me out in clearing up errors  because I was buried in current activity, thus the e-mail to you asking for  your help.

We sold this gas for one day only.  In MOPS, the  path was nominated for 1/26 only.  However, in POPS the path was nominated  and confirmed for 1/26-1/31.  This should have been showing up as a  bridgeback error during the month.  Also, someone should have identified that  the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.  This discrepancy  should have been found before we closed out January.  I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id  in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS).   This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group,  who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.  The resolution, not the  problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an  explanation of what happened.  Some one still needs to find out how the gas  was confirmed for the 27th-31st.  Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the  OBA.

Most of these instances have been due  to oversight; one instance was at the direction of Commercial.  I want to re-emphasise the importance of ensuring that all risk books are  officialized at the end of the day.  This is the only mechanism we have to  ensure that all trading positions are included in the Daily Position Report  and daily trading limit calculations, both of which are reviewed by top Enron  management on a daily basis.  This must be a top priority for Risk Management  and we need to do whatever we have to do to make sure we remember to perform  this function at the end of every day.  Furthermore, it is totally  unacceptable for Commercial to direct any book administrator to not  officialize a risk book.  If this occurs again and you are uncomfortable with  dealing with the situation, please inform your Desk Controller, Steve Jackson  or myself immediately and we will address the issue.  I realise every one of you has a lot on your plate and are working  significant hours to get your jobs done.

A few months ago, I realized that I had reached the limit of my academic career options, at least for the near future.  After reading about careers in the private sector and discussing possibilities with some family members and friends, it became apparent that my technical and mathematical skills could be transferred to the private sector, with better long-term career options and a more dynamic workplace environment than in academic research.  The energy industry is particularly attractive as it begins to deregulate.  I have been directed to Enron by several different people as a very forward-thinking and growing company and one which values its employees.  Because of my statistical and mathematical skills, I am interested in a position as a quantitative analyst.  However, if there are other areas where the people at Enron think I could contribute, I am open to other options.  My other experience, such as project management, is outlined in my resume.  I have worked in a collaboration of 30 astrophysicists from the US, Ireland, and England and I am a capable independent worker as well.  I have excellent written and oral communication skills and have made presentations to audiences ranging from technical experts to school-aged children.

Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors. Now it's time to look forward. With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company. On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.", "folder": "personal"}, {"cleaned_text": " Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.  Deal Terms  -- The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing. -- ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas. --   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. --   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.  Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.  Management of Newly Formed Company  Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.  I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.  Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.  The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.  As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.  I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.  I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.  And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

This communication  also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network  due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.  It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40%  increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to  you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter  proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.  While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC,  Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation  efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it  is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group  and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.    Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals  within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those  with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake  Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our  affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO  options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between  September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial  Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network  benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other  charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be  pre-certified with UHC.  These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary  Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.  If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's  customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases  the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.   If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to  UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained  by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).  Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.

I appreciate the part-time offer, however, I must admit that I did not find the terms very favorable. Unlike a person who is permamently located in Houston, I would have the inconvenience and cost of commuting between Austin and Houston, and of accomodation both in Austin and Houston.  I really would love to work in the Research Group and am sincere about this. I would just hope that you would consider compensating me at manager level so that I can cover transportation, accomodation expenses and more importantly, justify the decision to devote at least half of my time to Enron away from my thesis.

As a matter of fact I expect and encourage the members of the group to disagree with me (or anybody else)  on any subject.

Vince       Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON 01/04/2001 03:10 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Sorry.  Hi Vince, I am sorry for correcting on the revenue of the different auctions.  Vickrey 1961 showed that all 4 kinds of auctions would yield the same  expected revenue to the auctioneer. (Dutch, English, first price-sealed bid,  and second-price sealed bid.) In fact, the selling price is equal to the  valuation of the second highest bidder. For example, in Vickrey auction,  everyone bids at his own valuation.

I am copying my family member on this note so you will have their email addresses if needed and also to update them on Nicaragua. I am having a good time especially considering my apprehension before I left Houston.  The way to travel is to hook up with a realtor who will take you all over for free.  The realtor (Steve) lived in Costa Rica for 20 years then moved to Nicaragua 6 years ago.  He is about our age and a true gentlemen.  Yesterday he took me to his house on one of the small islands on Lake Nicaragua.  He owns his own island.  There are about 300 of them.  Too rustic for me, but very peaceful. He arranged my travel from Granada to the Blue Bay Resort at Papaguyo Beach in Costa Rica.  It is only three or four hours away driving, but is a hassle because you have to cross the border.  If you want to see the property I visited, there are pictures at www.ranchosantana.com.  I feel safe here, but the real test will be when I! > cross the border.  Today I left my room for breakfast very early.  I didn't lock up as I expected to return before the maid.  My money and passport were easily accesible.  The maid came while I was at breakfast, but nothing was missing.  Unbelievable since this might not have happened in the US. Today there is a big festival here in Granda with fireworks, a horse parade, etc.  Tomorrow I leave for the resort in Costa Rica.  The charge for the Internet use here is about $2.50 per hour.  Lisa and I paid $1.00 per minute on the cruise.  You  won't here from me again if the resort internet charges are astronomical.

This is the first step in our plan to migrate our security processing to eRequest.  eRequest is an electronic way to request access to applications/software, security, space allocation, XMS expense report set up, and access to conference rooms.  eRequest will take the place of submitting your request to the ETS Solution Center or the Omaha Helpdesk mailboxes.  There are a number of issues remaining to be addressed, specifically licensing costs for new software and the potential impact of the upcoming implementation of iBuyit.  However, we want to provide you with the opportunity to begin using the tool.  The steps are as follows:  Go to http://www.ets.enron.com ; select the Solution Center page; and then click on the   icon. If you have a Corp id, click on the CORP LOGON button.  If you do not have a Corp id, select the NON-CORP login.  You will have to input your email id or select SEARCH and select your email address from a pick list. If you have not used the system before, you will be prompted to set up a New Logon Profile.  You must provide your company number, cost center, social security number, location and phone number. Select the button that represents the type of request you want to make (i.e., Update Account Access, New Account, etc.). Confirm who the request is for; you may have to do a SEARCH to find your id.  Click OK when it's confirmed. Select the service you desire (i.e., APPLICATIONS). It is very important that you select ETS-GPG for your Region.  If you do not, your request will not be processed.

The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.  Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.  I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.

Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for  him to remain on the floor.  This will need to be delayed until IT number 1  is completed (cataloguing his work). 2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know  our positions and curves next. 3. Remove his security pass, and insist that he is always accompanied when in  the building.  Sharad is to sit with him while he catalogues his work.  IT-type stuff: 1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the  group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more  than a day or two. 2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam's h: drive for weekly intervals  over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has  deleted. 3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records  of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  I'm worried  about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out. 4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from  Anjam's c: drives.  There may be useful info here too. 5. Revoke all internet access, whether via Explorer or Notes mail. 6. Get a record of all files he has printed over the last couple of months.

The issue we face is that the underlying legal structure of EOL,  namely the Password Application and the Electronic Trading Agreement, always  defines the Enron entity with which counterparty trades as \"Enron\", and  similarly the counterparty is always \"Counterparty\".  Also, a trade that is  entered into is defined as a \"Transaction\".  For this reason, we had ensured  that the nomenclature in our GTCs, the market descriptions, and the EOL  confirmations that we have drawn up, was conformed with the underlying  structure.  If Mark or yourself  think that the US GTCs do not need to  reflect this, please could you advise so that I can arrange for changes to  the GTCs to be made.  Best regards,   Edmund.

I'm very disappointed and angry with comments that have been made since the  HPL Asset Disposition Team realized the impact of what has been communicated  to them over the last six weeks regarding the level of Bammel cushion gas  that would be available on March 31, 2001.  The following is designed to set  the record straight in the spirit of \"Facts Are Friendly\".    First of all, it has been communicated multiple times over the last six -  eight weeks to Patrick Wade and Brian Redmond and brought to the attention of  Wes Colwell,  Dave Delainey and John Lavorato in the meeting held before year  end to discuss the unwind cost.  All parties indicated that it was not a  problem and that everyone was aware of the situation.  Now Im hearing just  the opposite and in fact insinuations that the Storage Book screwed up by:   1) originally booking injection and withdrawal assumptions down to 60 BCF.   2) reversing the April, 2007 5.5 BCF injection assumption on December 31,  2000.   1)  The decision to record injection / withdrawal assumption down to 60 BCF  was made in 1992 by Kevin Hannon and Steve Smaby.  This was based on          the fact that we had been down to 60 BCF physically in the several  years proceeding 1992.  Since 1992 we have been down top 60 BCF twice,  the          latest  being March, 1996.  Throughout this entire period the  Accounting Dept was well aware of the Bammel assumptions and the  physical           capabilities of the facility.    2)  The reversing of the Bammel assumptions has nothing to do with  anything.  When we communicated the unwind cost of $203 million it included  the         reversal of all assumptions including the April, 2007 injection.   This was appropriate since we would be down to the 60 BCF physical minimum.   In         addition we were told to make sure there was no Working Gas left  in the ground.  If the reversal of the assumption was the problem then it  could be         reversed, but then the unwind cost would go up. It has also been suggested to me that I should have continued to follow up  irregardless of the number of times I communicated the issue.  If I was  dealing with lower level employee's I would agree, but given the level  involved I feel this suggestion is totally out of line.    From my perspective the only way I had a chance of catching this issue was if  I had reveiwed all documents including the one specificly addressing the  cushion gas of 65.5 BCF.   I beleive everyone on this memo was communicated  to and was aware of the situation.  Perhaps they were involved with other  issues related to the sell?  I am disappointed in the way everyone is scuring  around to cover their backside.

I hope this finds you all safe and well.  Adrienne Greenheart, Writer I was one who wanted a better look. I wanted to get closer. And the price I paid was leaving my shoes in the middle of a pile of suffocating bodies.  At the Wall St. train stop people were covered with papers.  A plane crash. That's what everyone said.  Then a boom.  Everyone ran.  I ran to my office on Wall and Pearl and called my brother in Illinois. I wanted to be closer.  At the corner of Church and Broadway, I angled my way through a large, packed crowd to get the best view.  We talked about people jumping.  The police stood behind the yellow tape.  Minutes later, there was a boom.  I thought it was a bomb, so I crouched, but people ran, so I ran. I couldn't see anything.  I don't know how far I ran.  Couldn't see where I was running.  Didn't know if I was in a street or next to a building. Didn't know what street I was on.  No one could talk because the dust filled our throats.   After about ten steps I tripped over a pile of people and then people tripped on me. I laid there. The only sound was the falling of dust and debris.  No one moved under me.  The weight of people on top of me got heavier.  I couldn't breathe. I knew we were all going to die in that pile.  I pulled myself out of the pile.  My slip-ons slipped off.  I stood up and saw nothing.  Not even and inch in front of me.  I put my hands out and felt for something.  I bumped into the brick side of a building.  I bumped into milk crates.  I stopped. I had no idea what to do, and I knew everyone around me was suffocating.  I thought about my Mom and dad, they would be so sad to hear that I died.  I thought about my husband. Just married and I will not get to live my life with him.  I thought about my brothers.  They would cry.  I told myself to just keep trying to find away to air, but I didn't believe I would live. I bumped into something that I could feel the top of, so I lifted myself up. I worried I was going into the back of a dump truck, and I was scared I'd be trapped.  I didn't know if there was fire, or a bomb.  I didn't know how to protect myself ??\" find air.  Go up? ??\" so I didn't know for sure that a dump truck would be bad.  I think it was scaffolding.  I think I jumped over piles of bodies by climbing scaffolding. I pulled myself into a building. What building? I don't know.  And I took a breath.  I took two breaths.  I was sure the building would be bombed.  I looked for stairs.  I kept thinking I needed clean air.  I found a bathroom. I didn't realize I wanted water until it was there.  Four men inside. Two fighting   faucet.  I shared the toilet with another man.  We drank almost the whole bowl. Once the four of us were calmed by water and air, we ventured outside the bathroom.  We walked up stairs. S lowly.  We checked doors behind us, left them all open.  We got up only one floor.  We waited.  I cried.  They shared one can of apple juice. The intercom in the building announced stay where you are.  I was so relieved to know people knew we were there.  The intercom announced again and I thought another bomb would go off and I'd die.  I cried.  The guy with the apple juice put his arm around me.  I wondered why no one else cried.  The intercom announced to go down the stairs.  I picked up a wastebasket: I planned to fill it with water.  Planned to use it to shelter myself from the next bomb.  (I still had no idea the building collapsed.) In the lobby of the building someone gave me a Nantucket Nectar and told me to vomit.  I walked outside the building with the drink in my wastebasket. There was no one around. White everywhere.  The four of us had nowhere to go.   I couldn't remember where I was.  I walked toward the water.  Police directed very one north.  I asked a woman next to me, \"Where are we going?\" She said, \"I don't know.\"  She had no dust.  She looked so steady.  I followed her.  This was the beginning of her long protection. She said, \"You can walk home with me.  You need a shower.\"  I coughed.  She asked why I was carrying a wastebasket.  I said, \"In case there's another bomb.\"  She held on to my arm as we made our way next to the river.  In Chinatown, she bought me shoes.  At the Bowery we finally found a pay phone that didn't have a line of people.  So she called her husband and I sat down next to my wastebasket.  It was the first time I sat down, and I started crying. We resumed walking.  Sometimes we ran.  I made sure to keep up and I didn't tell Teresa that I was worried that I would faint.  I drank Nantucket Nectar every time I got dizzy. At 59th St. a plane went overhead and I screamed.  In front of Bloomingdales.   There was no one there from Wall St. I knew I looked crazy.  I screamed anyway.  I reminded everyone there were no planes allowed to fly.  Someone said, \"It's the army.\"  I came out from under my wastebasket and kept walking.  Theresa's apartment was 71st on the Upper West Side. Where everyone looked fine. In the shower, dripping debris down my body, I remembered one more moment under the rubble.  When I couldn't breathe. When I couldn't see.  In the middle of the dead quiet was a voice.  He said, \"Is there anyone here? Can someone hold my hand?\" I reached out to the voice, and held his hand.  It was shaking and the skin was old.  I squeezed and then I let go.  Betty Sweeny Business Development Associates, Inc.
