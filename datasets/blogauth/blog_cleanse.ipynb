      "              And Don't Forget to Feel Good About Yourself.   David Brooks takes another swing at hyper-competitive students, what he calls 'project kids,' in an  urlLink Op-Ed  in yesterday's Times.  The overall message of the piece is a good one: that high school students shouldn't be obsessed with getting into the 'top' college, or be overly burdened by the test scores, grades, and extracurricular activities that are prerequisite at a lot of these places.  But in making this plea, Brooks writes a lot of things are misleading or simply not true, and the average reader who take his advice to heart and actually act on it are setting themselves up for disappointment and failure.   First, Brooks, as only he can, makes generalizations like '[y]ou are being judged according to criteria that you would never use to judge another person and which will never again be applied to you once you leave higher ed.' This would be true, if you plan to being a subsistence fisherman in Bermuda or a porn star after graduation. For the rest of us, each step in our professional lives after college will involve being judged and (someday, hopefully) judging others along similar criteria. Sure, no one will care whether you were an officer in your school government; instead you will be asked equally meaningless and even more determinitive questions about your 'leadership' experience at your last job.   Second, Brooks makes the outrageous claim that measures like tests scores and GPA will never again be relevant in your life. That's not even true in the narrowest and most trivial sense of the statement, because you will be evaulated by your LSAT, or MCAT, or (at least partly) GRE scores. Not to mention your undergraduate GPA, not to mention your performance evaluations at work, given out by bosses who are, as hard as it may be to believe, a whole lot worse at objective evaluation than your teachers. It is this kind of sovereign disregard for reality that leads to statements like: 'Once you reach adulthood, the key to success will not be demonstrating teach-pleasing competence across fields.' Right, the key will be demonstrating boss-pleasing competence across competely arbitrary fields (e.g. 'is this guy a team-player,' or 'goal-oriented,' whatever those mean).  The last two problems are due to a sanguine view of the adult world, perhaps understandably so from someone as professionally successful and as well educated as Brooks himself. More troubling, however, is Brooks' characterization of liberal arts education.  Brooks writes that it's a travesty that high school students are forced to read things 'that are intrinsically boring to [them],' and that the entire system of general education causes students to 'stop thinking about which subjects are boring and which exciting,' such that 'each class [becomes] a hoop you must jump through on your way to a first-class university. You learn[] to thrive in adult-supervised settings.' The result of this process for these over-achieving students, Brooks believes, is that they will be 'whittle[d]...down into a bland, complaisant achievement machine.'   I gather his preferred alternative is that we all become either creative, passionate geniuses or ignorant, incurious slobs (or fishermen or porn stars). Because the purpose of a liberal arts education is to give students the exposure to subjects they may not have considered 'intrinsically interesting' simply because they'd never had sufficient knowledge of them.   There is certainly a subset of the high school population out there which should take this advice to heart. But I suspect that those students who are completely sure of what they want to do, and already possess the skills, discipline, and tenacity to achieve their self-discovered goals have enough of a clue not to get derailed by the competitive college-admissions environment in the first place.  But most students, including this one, were largely clueless about most things in high school and for most of college (if not afterwards as well). For us, I think the 'achievement machine' is a hedge against the formation of or changes to future goals, precisely because it is undifferentiated in the skills it imparts on those willing to learn, and precisely because it gives us the generic credentials (GPA, LSAT, empty extracurriculars) that will be needed in the place of genuine passion that simpy may not be there. It would be wonderful if finding careers were like finding love, an experience that hits us suddenly so that we know we've found 'the one.' But I also suspect that most people don't really care that deeply about   any  career, and couldn't give a monkey as long and what he ends up doing satisfies a few basic criteria (pays enough to live on, at least occassionally interesting, etc.). For those us, it is perhaps best to stack up our credentials, because when two (and there will certainly be more) equally disinterested people apply for the same job, guess who has a better shot of getting it?  It's great to send optimistic messages like 'the [admissions] letters you get over the next few weeks don't determine anything.' But before we decide that our glass is half-full, we better make sure we have a glass, and a way to get some liquid into it.           \n",

      "              Readings on Terror  of the law firm variety.   I came across this  urlLink site  , while reading  urlLink And What Thanks Do We Get , which is a weblog that (we think) is written by a couple of partners are a smallish sounding firm.   But the anonymous writer of the first blog claims to be a hiring partner at a 'large firm in a major city,' and sounds pretty credible, not that I can really tell. It could be a total sham, just some associate or law student making a joke, but the whole thing does sound oddly sincere at points.  In any event, some of the posts are really funny, but mostly the site is pretty sobering - about the long hours and client demands, and this guy is a partner! But the hiring story in the very first entry is worth citing in length:  My favorite interviewing story is the time I made the law student totally break down. He was a law review kid, from either Columbia or NYU, I think. He asked me what my favorite thing about the firm was. I told him it was the way everyone was so nice to me after my nervous breakdown.   'I explained that I'd been in the office for a week straight, doing due diligence on a really important case, as a first-year associate, and the partner I was working for came in and just started screaming at me, throwing things, telling me he was going to throw me right through the window if I didn't get my act together and start earning my salary. So I started crying, and he took the picture frame from my desk, and slammed it into the ground, and glass went everywhere, and I just lost it, and had to be sent away to the hospital to recover for a few days. But when I got back, I explained, everyone was really nice about it. They only made me work 6 days that week, and even let me grab a quick lunch that Friday.   'So I could tell this kid didn't want to believe anything I was saying, but I kept a straight face through it all. And he asked if I was telling the truth, and I told him I could show him the picture frame to prove it -- that I had the broken picture frame in my drawer, all this time. And I reached for the drawer, to open it, and he quickly said of course he believed me, and wanted to know if things were really that bad.   'I was the last interview before he went out to lunch with two associates, and when they filed their reports they said he was a mess, couldn't stop shaking and fidgeting, asked all these lifestyle questions, and went to the bathroom right after the main course, and they thought he might have vomited it all up. This is power. Making law students vomit. This is why I like being a lawyer.  There are a few other posts that end with comments like 'and that's why I like being a lawyer,' including one about how he could have made some paralegal copy a stack of papers just because.  This reminds me, I should get an early start at Career Services looking for DOJ jobs.          \n",

      "              'Covering My Life'   I was, and still am, in the middle of eating the worst tuna sandwich I've ever had, when I received an e-mail asking about the URL of my blog. I excitedly wrote back only to find out that the soliciter was really only interested in a friend's blog that's linked on my page - try to guess which, it's not hard.  I indignantly wrote back, and the offender responded that my blog doesn't cover the events of my life. So I thought about posting about how bad my tuna fish sandwich is, but that might be interpreted as too 'theoretical.'  Other goings-on: I'm flying down to Atlanta Wednesday for the remainder of the week, and will also be there for next week. I get to stay at the swanky W Hotel for most of the time this trip, which should be really neat, even though Lauren said that the place is a little JAPy.   This scheduling change does mean that I'll have to miss the law school reception on Wednesday, which is definitely a shame. I'd really wanted to meet Dean Kagan, if just so I can tell her that her little brother was my favorite teacher in high school. What a small world. Also, there are suppose to be a bunch of young alumni at the event, at least some of whom are probably junior associates (those that can escape for a part of an evening) and it would have been pretty useful to ask them about career stuff.   In baseball news: I dropped LeCroy for Mauer in one of my leagues, which may or may not have been a good move. On the one hand there is all this hype about Mauer and he will be the starting catcher. One the other hand, it takes Yahoo! forever to update players' positions (Chipper Jones was at third base all of last year), and LeCroy will be the DH, so he'll still be putting up decent numbers in my catcher's position.   I'm also trying to compile some semblance of a reading list for the month of May. Columbia's PhD program in political theory has a pretty useful reading list, and I think I'll start with the following:  Tocqueville's   Democracy in America , because it always sounds insightful when people refer to it, and I've never read it.  Freud's   Civilization and Its Discontens . I have no idea what this is about, but I like reading about discontent; and I guess Civilization is... pretty cool too?  Plato's   Gorgias , because it has a funny title.  Now, I have to talk about this tuna sandwich. It's called a 'spa' sandwich and it's suppose to be healthy, so they use carrots instead of celery and nothing instead of mayo. And it tastes just awful. Don't ever buy it. Ok, I'm done. Hopefully something more substantive and 'theoretical' later today.          \n",

Talk about coincidence, that a guy with a name like that became an economist. I wonder if he comes from a long line of economists.

      "              Fantasy Baseball  I did another fantasy baseball draft this Friday, and I thought I drafted a pretty good team, but they it looks really weak based on last year's stats. I think it's because the majority of my guys had years cut short by injury, or are still on their way up as players. So hopefully they will outperform their stats this year.  Anyway, here's my team: C:   LeCroy 1B: Sweeney 2B: Castillo 3B: Lowell SS: Jeter OF: Guerrero OF: Abreu OF: Pierre Util: Baldelli BN: Dunn BN: Ensberg BN: Kearns  SP: Millwood SP: Pedro SP: Brandon Webb SP: Harden SP: Penny SP: Myers CL: Rhodes CL: Percival CL: MacDougal  So, I think I should have the steals market cornered with Castillo, Pierre, Abreu, Baldelli, and Jeter. Hopefully Baldelli will hit for more power this year. And Dunn and Keanrs could give me great years too. We'll see. Another thing, Joe Mauer is still undrafted in my league, as is Shawn Chacon I think. I'd think about picking them up, but don't know who to drop on my team.  Thoughts?          \n",

      "              Before This Blog Gets Outsourced  Thought I'd post something not about the law for a change: a pretty well-argued essay,  urlLink The Outsourcing Bogeyman  by Daniel W. Drezner in Foreign Affairs, on why the flow of white-collar jobs from the U.S. to countries like India is not a bad thing.   One major complaint these days about outsourcing is that too many American jobs are being lost o overseas labor. The loss of white-collar jobs like computer programming and data analysis this time mirrors the loss of manufacturing jobs that started in the 1980s and accelorated in te 1990s. Drezner offers two responses to critics of outsourcing and proponents of protectionism. First, he argues that the claims of the number of jobs lost are often exaggerated for a variety of reasons, such as the fact that the baseline numbers used are often inflated 2000 bubble-economy numbers, or that the rate of outsourcing now is as much due to a management fad as to the long-term strategies of companies. So, the result in the near future is that the gross job loss will not be as high as people predict now.  The second argument is that the  net  loss of jobs will actually be negative, meaning that the flow of certain jobs abroad will lead to more and higher-paying jobs created at home. Drezner uses as his support for this argument both historical evidence and economic dogma. He observes that we are currently undergoing a structural shift in the economy, so that job growth will naturally lag a bit, just as it did during the last such shift in the early 1990s. The result of that shift was the rise of the information economy of which the United States was the undisputed leader. [On a side note,  I just recently read somewhere the use of the term silicon capitalism, which is I gather a variant of or a successor to finance capitalism.] Thus, the current 'jobless recovery' is a natural growing pain that accompanies such shifts.   Overall I'm inclined to buy his argument up to this point. I do see a few problems though. First, Drezner, like just about every other free trade advocate I've heard or read, is very vague about exactly the kind of jobs that will replace the jobs lost to overseas labor. He asserts that they will be more numberous, higher-paying, and require more sophisticated skills and training. But what kinds of jobs these might be is unclear. His only concrete examples are jobs that require geographic proximity, like sales and marketing, and the kind of jobs that are likely not be outsources at all, like 'retail and restaurants...and personal care.' It's hard to believe that any of these jobs are the high-paying, high added-value jobs that Drezner prophesied.  The other problem is not so much a shortcoming in Drezner argument as it is a problem (as I see it, with my near-nonexistent knowledge of the subject) with economic theory. Drezner claims that under ideal conditions, countries would behave much like individual firms do, and produce only those things at which they have a competitive advantage. This way, the economy operates at its most efficient level, and the total wealth of the world is at its peak. But the current trend of job creation and destruction in the United States suggests that, if this continues, the U.S.'s competitive advantage will be in the following areas: Executive Management, Advance Technology, Burger-flipping, and Bed pan-emptying. Now it's great that Americans will have a ton of jobs available to them in the first two industries, but it's really terrible for the people in this country who can't and don't want to jobs in those industries, because then, short of moving abroad, they're left with only the McJobs.   Specialization by firms work for people at large because if I'm bad at or despise one kind of work, I can go to another firm and find a new career. Most people switch careers in their lives at least once. Very few people switch countries. But if the trend towards country-specialization continues, the reasoning seems to me, switching careers may entail switching countries, and that is neither possible nor desirable for the vast majority of people.   Lastly, while Drezner's arguments are designed to counter the claims of people who oppose outsourcing for fear of domestic job loss, it completely ignores the other half of the interest group against the globalization of jobs, namely those who are concerned about the labor enviroment in the countries to which U.S. jobs are moving. It is no wonder why so many companies are outsourcing their jobs abroad - cheap labor. And while there exists economic reasons too complicated for me to understand that explain  why  workers in other country earn three pennies to the dollar of U.S. workers, there is also the simple reason that there are often fewer if any regulations in these other countries, allowing companies to exploit workers to a degree they could not possibly do (at least not all the time) in the U.S.  This last concern could just be economic naivete; it is arguable that the kind of governmental regulations and maket conditions cannot arise without there first being an impetus in the form of mass exploitation. Job growth and exploitation may be a necessary factor in the development of a strong labor market and worker-friendly laws, but surely it is not a sufficient factor. Without a hospitable political environment, there will unlikely ever be the kinds of regulations upon companies that will make the lives of workers significantly better in the long run. Also, governments that are not responsive to the needs of the people are strengthened by the growth of local and multinational elites at the expense of the rest of the population, since a strong middle-class is what authoritarian governments fear most. Job growth alone will not spur the political change that is also necessary for better jobs and living conditions. To think that would be political naivete.          \n",

      "              Stalin, Mao, Honecker & Pol Pot LLP?  I came across this ' urlLink Report of the Task Force on Lawyers' Quality of Life ' by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, a fine organzation where I did my 'community service' hours in high school - nothing spells community like a bunch of New York lawyers.   As expected, the report was at once vacuous and difficult to read. It dispenses advise ranging from the merely usesless, like '[t]he Task Force recommends that firms endevour to create an environment that recognizes that junior associates lack knowledge in substantive practial areas and are enetitled to seek appropriate guidance while assuming appropriate levels of responsibility,' while also chewing appropriate sticks of gum and blowing appropriate sized bubbles - while walking - should those activities conform to the firm's core values, to the suicidal, to the useless and trivial, like analyzing the optimal proportion of paralegals/associates/partners assigned to each secretary.   When I started reading the report I guess I was expecting to actually learn something useful, and in fact I did. I noticed that there seem to be a lot of commonalities between the language of law firms and the language of Communists. What do I mean by this?  For starters there is the propensity to form committees for everything: Executive committees, compensation committees, diversity committees, ethics committees, finance committees, library committees, space allocation committees, sexual harassment committees, morale committees (because nothing improves morale more than the recommendations of a committees, except maybe serving on such a committee) and so on and so on. Compare these committees to ye olde committees on iron ore production and on newspaper propaganda, and of course, to the Politburo, and the Standing Members thereof (which I guess would be the same thing as the Managing Partners...).   Then there is the idea of 'lock-step compensation' - paying classes of associates the same salary without regard to job performance - as a disincentive to work hard. Sounds familiar? One of the arguments against the command economy is that without market forces adjusting wages, workers and managers would have no incentive to do more since they get paid the same salary whether they produce the same minimum or three times the minimum.  Also, 64% of large New York firms included in the survey had associates' committees, which I guess is kind of the like firm equivalent of the Communist Youth Leagues, the training group for future apparachiks.   Finally, like communists states, firms are ruled largely by the personalities of a few Great Men; and at this point I think the analogy breaks down, but I still rather like it, so I'll go on for a bit longer. I'd imagine that the 'About Us' page on the web site of Stalin, Mao, Honecker & Pol Pot LLP (or just Stalin Mao, as they'd be known) would look something like this:  Josef Stalin:  Education: Revolutionary University, LL.B., magna cum laude (1918); Law Review: Agitation Editor; Order of the Sickle  Josef Stalin is one of the senior partners at the firm. Before forming Stalin Mao, he was a founding partner at Stalin & Associates (formerly Lenin, Trotsky & Stalin), where during his tenure he was an international trail-blazer in the practice area of Gulag law. Stalin's experience include representing plaintiffs in  Collectivizers v. Peasants , which resulted in a verdict of mass starvation, and  In re Great Patriotic War .   Mao Zedong:  Education: Revolutionary University, LL.B., summa cum laude (1921); Law Review: Propaganda Editor; Order of the Sickle  Mao Zedong is one of the industry's top rainmakers in corporate and population re-structuring law. He was formerly the managing partner at the most populous law firm/communist state in the world before joining Stalin Mao. There he oversaw the complex process of deindustrializing an entire country and engineering the stavation of some 30 million people. Mao also holds an adjunct position at Revolution University Law School and regularly teaches a course on Law and Cultural Revolution.   Erich Honecker:   Education: Die Revolutionare Universitat (1969); Law Review: Secret Police Editor; Yale Law School, LL.M. (1971);  Erich Honecker is the lead partner in the firm's M&A practice group. Among his major transactions is the acqusition of his former firm by its arch-rival and westernly neighbor.    Pol Pot:  Education: (Self Taught)  Pol Pot heads the Education Law practice group at Stalin Mao, and is one of the most recognized scholars writing and acting on the subject. He authored the seminal article on the relationship between communism and intellectuals, entitled  Why The Part Needs to Kill Everyone Who's Had More Than An Elementary-School Education  25 Duq. L.J. 317 (1974). Unlike most scholars, Pol Pot was also able to carry out the reforms proposed in his article. In addition to his role at the firm, Pol Pot is also the chairman of the CLE committee at the state bar association.           \n",

      "              Readings on SEX(ual harassment)  Laura Kipnis at Slate has an amusing  urlLink essay  on the Naomi Wolf story. Her basic point is that sexual advances made by co-workers aren't necessarily always threatening and disempowering, sometimes they're just absurdly funny and rather empowering, since it gives these (almost always) women the awesome power of the rejection. Of course, when that co-worker is also a boss, the issue becomes slightly less funny. Kipnis also proposes the idea that men who make these advances, even though they occupy positions of power and prestige, often do so out of insecurity and a need for validation rather than as an exercise in some phallic expression of dominance. The case she picked seems to support her point.   Wolf recently made public her experience of being hit on by her intellectual hero and mentor, the (apparently, I don't know who he is) eminent Harold Bloom, an experience so revolting that she threw up after being propositioned. Wolf, who is now a (apparently, I don't know who she is) famous and respected authority in her field (of something or the other), claims that she is still haunted by the experience.   It is in making this claim that Kipnis thinks is going too far. After all, given Wolf's current position none of the potential harms associated with an unwanted sexual advance exist, and all of the potentially empowering and humorous effects still do. Kipnis advises that situations like this one are not necessarily so uncommon, and that we should not always think about workplace chat-ups as 'damsels-in-distress narratives.' She closes: '[t]he power actually doesn't flow in only one direction in these encounters, nor does the vulnerability, even when the professional roles are—gasp!—asymmetrical. Sisters are powerful too, even more so when armed with a sense of humor.'   Also, an  urlLink article  on a case on the Supreme Court's docket about whether an employer should be held strictly liable for sexual harassment when an employee quits (as oppose to being fired) because of an intolerably hostile work environment. I post this because of the unfortunate name of 'constructive discharge' given to the act of quitting because of a hostile environment.           \n",

Harvard University announced recently that it is putting a cap on the compensation paid out to the managers of its endowment investments. Yes, Harvard has by far the largest endowment in the country and one that has grown at an extraordinary pace in the last ten years, but that hardly justifies the compensation these glorified stock-jockies were getting.  The combined compensation for the six highest paid employees of the management company last year exceeded $100 million, with Maruice Samuels earning $35.1 million, David Mittelman earning $34.1 million, and Barry Larson earned a lowly $17.3 million, which was apparently so pathetic that Mr. Larson is leaving along with a dozen or so other Havard Management Co. employees to found their own hedge fund.

      "              Sights  On my walk from the subway back home today I saw this man, he must have been in his 50's, riding a tiny little bicycle. The bike had a detached car radio stuck on the to handles, and the radio was connected to a small boombox, with which he played loud salsa music as he cruised down the street. I wonder if he needed the car radio because the boombox's radio was broken, but then why couldn't he just get smaller speakers to play the car radio? It was probably a fashion thing; fifty year-old Spanish guys are always the trend setters.   What's next, their own cable cooking show?  The Times Sunday Magazine has a short  urlLink article  about a  urlLink philosophy professor at CCNY  who has his own counseling practice (over which he's currently in litigation against his own university). The guy's claim, which is somewhat plausible, is that many if not most of the problems people go or contemplate going to see a psychiartrist or clinical psychologist about are really philosophical problems that can be solved with the help of a trained socratic interlocutor, i.e. philosophy professors. Lots of times our problems arise from faulty logic or muddled and confused values. Everyone at some point or another has questions about ethics, the meaning of life and happiness, what's truly valuable, and so forth. Philosophers are really best trained to handle these problems, and can do so in less time and at less expensee than medical doctors.   The mental health profession, of course, strongly opposes the idea of philosophers dispensing advice. Their claim, also plausible, is that people who really may need medical help will not be getting it by going to philosophers waxing on and on about Plato or Aquinas or Kierkegaard. One never knows if a philosopher would prescribe Sarte for a suicidal despressive or Nietzsche for a paranoid schizophrenic.  This actually reminds me of an amazingly similar scheme a friend in college had (he's probably not going to read this since he's in Hondurar with the Peace Corps.). His service was called 'Justify Your Wrong-Doing,' and provides, well, pretty much what it advertises. Say that your conscience was bothering you because you made up some bogus excuse in turning in your paper late, or that you cheated on your taxes or something. Just call and explain your situation, and my friend would explain why your actions were, after all, perfectly justifiable if not affirmatively virtuous. He rates were 50 cents for minor sins, and a 1 dollar for major sins. Considering that, accoridng to the article, executives at companies like IBM and GE have made philosophers tens of thousands of dollars for fancied-up versions of the same thing, I'm very surprised that he never had any customers.   I was thinking though, that head-shrinking is not the only option available to philosophers who want to 'practice.' So, in no particular, here are 11 promising careers fit for the professional philosopher:  11. Career-counselor. For those philosophers, like Aristotle (who, since he's one of the few philosopher I know, will figrue largely in this list), have a teleology, career-counseling is a fantastic option. So many young people today are completely lost in the wide array of choice available to them that a philosophical exploration into what they're meant to become would definitely be in demand. Philosophers would have this market cornered in no time with advice like 'Being a medical orderly is fulfilling your true destiny.' Probably only soft determinists or compatibilists should try out for these jobs - see #7 below...  10. Information Technology Manager. For philosophers of mind, this is a perfect opportunity to work all the time with the latest computers to see if they are or can become intelligent beings. Unless you work for a university, in which case you'll have four-year-old technology.  9. Investment manager. For Midieval philosophers. This job normally entails explaining to lots of people why all of their money is gone even though they invested in 'hot' stocks like Enron and Worldcom and bubbleEconomy.com. The people with degrees in economics offer explanations like 'this is just a market correction,' or 'the fundamentals of the company are strong, never mind the lack of assets or a business plan,' or 'I didn't know the officers were all crooks.' But only philosophers can tell the straight story, that this is simply all the work of Fortuna, on whose wheel all of us spin from the pinnacle to the nadir. Instead of reading Warren Buffet (I don't know if he even writes anything...), the philosopher investment manager would direct his clients to read  urlLink Boethius' The Consolation of Philosophy .  8. Military Communications Officer. For all philosophers. The military uses a lot of jargon totally incomprehensible to outsiders for every little thing. So do philosophers. This is a perfect match, and you get the added credibility of a Ph.D.  7. Fortune-teller, for the hard determinists, those philosophers who do not believe in free will. All mental functions are caused by chemical reactions in the brain, and these chemical reactions follow the laws of physics. In any physical system, or at least those at the scale of neurotransmitter activity, if we know the current positions and velocity of each particle, we could theoretically calculate their positions into the indefinite future. So, given enough information and calculating power, these philosophers could tell you who you're going to marry, whether you'll make Law Review, and whether you'll ever get rid of that weird looking growth. But the marketing will probably be pretty hard without the crystal ball and all those weird playing cards.  6. Match-maker. For any philosopher who did his or her dissertation on Books VIII and IX of the  Nicomachean Ethics  on friendship. They will know which people are truly meant to be together for life, probably; I don't know, I've never read the  Ethics .   5. Stand up comedian, er, philosopher. This idea was from Mel Brook's hilarious  urlLink History of the World Part I . Philosophers of language would do well in this gig. After all, so many jokes really just exploit the vague areas of meaning and language. 'And what's the deal with the demonstrative pronoun? I mean, it's suppose to refer to physical objects, but it's just a signifier for other words! What genius thought of this one?' I think I'd be more worried if that last joke were actually funny...  4. Interior Decorator. Actually, I think phenomenologists have a lot of options for practice, pretty much anything that deals with qualia, or the  experience  of experiencing, that are too vague or complicated for normal people to be want to assess on their own. Restaurant critics would be a pretty good job for phenomenologists. But  feng shui  seems to be all the rage these days, and that's all about the most ineffable of qualia.  3. Fashion Designer. For philosopher of aethetics. This is related to #4. I originally thought that aethetics would be good for interior design since it's nominally concerned with beauty and all that. But actually, just like fashion designers with their weird runway shows, philsophers of beauty seem more concerned with conceptual questions rather than practical ones. Philsophers be ideal for this job, since they can design outfits that no one will ever wear, and still make a good argument as to the value of making them(something about the intrinsic value of beautiful things, like the distant-plant example. E-mail me if you don't know what I'm talking about, or e-mail me if you do know what I'm talking about because I probably don't know what I'm talking about).  2. Taxidermist. Philosphers would make great quality control experts in a taxidermy practice. 'Is this elephant stuffed? Is it stuffed now that I've taken out one grain of sand? After two? After three? After four?.... I've just removed the last grain of sand, is it still stuffed? No? Then you better go and stuff it.'  1. Lawyer.  Haha, no, just kidding. Thanks for reading the rest of the list though.          \n",

      "              Has the Fear already gripped me?   I report to first-year orientation for law school in 164 days. I won't be allowed to even try to apply for first-year summer jobs for another 92 days on top of that, and I likely will not have to make any meaningful decision about whether and which firm summer job to accept until the winter of my  second  year, or 164+90+365+... well you get the idea.  But I'm already starting to do something that can be called a sorry excuse for research into my employment prospects. I started a spread sheet a few weeks ago, and have been slowly trying to fill in the data points, as if these numbers and boolean values mean anything. Example fields include raw data from the  urlLink NALP  like:   starting salary (which turns out to be the least helpful since they're all mostly the same),  bonus criteria,  partnership length and structure,  salary divided by weekly-hours-worked, associates-to-partners-ratio, summer hiring numbers, size of dinner allowance for all those late nights at the office  and also a myriad of indices, based on surveys from sources like  urlLink this , and  urlLink this :  Family friendliness, Quality of work assigned, Self-esteem, How satisfying work is,  urlLink NYLawyer.com  Misery-Index number [oh if only there were such a thing!]  I noticed that nowhere is my spreadsheet is there a column for the firms' practice area, which, one might think is an important piece of information to assimilate. I think part of the reason is that this type of data is not Excel-friendly, or at least I don't know how to make it Excel-friendly. But it's also because I have no idea what these practice areas mean much less any idea of whether or not I want to practice in them. So, short of finding a firm (or even a partner, really) that specializes in 'sitting around discussing stuff that's interesting and kind of related to the law but probably is not profitable for any of our clients, oh wait we don't have any anymore,' I don't think listing all of the practice groups will help me at this point.  Not that listing gathering any of this data helps, really. But I think my total indifference to and non-participation in the undergraduate recruiting process, and the resulting clueless job-search for this year has made me acutely fearful of being unprepared when the time does arrive. It also doesn't help that so many people I know, save those who are already locked-in the professional or grad-school track, are having the same if not worse problems with finding a good, satifsying job that could maybe translate into a good, satisfying career.   This is largely just due to my characteristic risk-aversion. [On a side note that's sort of related to risk, I've discovered that Slinkies make excellent spill-guards on one's desk. I'm putting my soft drink cans in the slinky so that I won't accidentally knock them over and spill Diet Coke all over original documents... again.] But a lot of it is also, I think, attributable to the mood of the legal profession and beyond. The attitude among so many intelligent, highly educated, and idealistic people in and out of law school is that money (and the associated security, comfort, and in many cases familial and filial duty) and fulfillment (of intellect and of conscience) necessarily or at least often contingently are trade-offs. Given this trade off, any decision you make will make you either a sell-out, possibly content but probably unhappy , or a pauper, possibly good-doing but probably ineffectual. How to decide!  Of course, the prospects are not really this grim. But I also don't believe that the path beyond this trade-off lies in banal refrains like 'just do what you want and what interests you.' It's surely a lot more complicated than just an act of will. And I think what drives people into jobs they hate is not just a fear of failure, but a fear of complexity as well. So for those of us who lack Zarathustrian will, a little information-gathering might not be such a bad idea.          \n",

Now, in fairness, it does have sort of a floral pattern by the collar and on the inside of the sleeves.

      "              Readings   In the New York Review of Books, Jared Diamond, of  urlLink Guns, Germs, and Steel  fame,  urlLink writes  about two recent books on Easter Island. The story of Eastern Island is amazing in two aspects. First, there are those mysterious giant heads that everyone's heard about. But what is even more interesting is the rise and fall of the civilization that build those giant heads.   It must take both a highly organized society and an island abundant in natural sources (for Easter Island is the most geographically remote place on Earth, so all of the raw materials must have been indigenous) to make possible the quarrying, transporting, and building of these statues. But Eastern Island today is uninhabited and void of trees taller than seven feet. When Europeans happened upon the island they found the inhabitants to be 'small, lean, timid, and miserable.' What the explorers did not know at the time was that the population of the island declined drastically in the century or so before their arrival, accompanying the general collapse of the island's human civilzation and natural wealth.   Experts on the subject seem to agree that Easter Island is a natural example of the nightmare scenarios projected by environmentalists if humans continue to strip the Earth of natural resources with our present disregard. Diamond wonders if, like we do today, the Easter Islanders thought that technological innovation would save the day before all of their natural resources run out? Sadly, it didn't.   Incidently, I've been seeing all of these ads in the New York subways from BP, about how the company is investigating new energy technologies and so on. And the ads all say 'beyond petroleum' like they want you to think that that's what BP stands for. It is, of course, the merged non-representational acronym for British Petroleum (ah,  that's  what BP stands for) and Amoco, the world's silver medalist in oil conglomeration.   And I just realized that I've pretty much summed up an article that is itself a not-too-long book review... I feel like such a bottom-feeder. In my defense, Diamond does refer to the two books in the review -  The Enigmas of Easter Island  by John Flenley and Paul Bahn, and  Among Stone Giants  by Jo Anne Van Tilburg - as 'difficult.'           \n",

      "              I'm not an grad student; grad students go to meetings....  A very funny piece of what an AA meeting might sound like if it were  urlLink 'Grad. Students Anonymous'  instead. That it was written by two tenured professors at Amherst College lends, I think, a bit of credibility to it - we can see that even people who have 'made it' went through this kind of crippling angst.  It seems that everything I read about the life of grad students and young phd's is a lot like what I hear about young associates, an endless stream of complaints, regrets, and warnings. But surely  some  abd's and phd's must lead fulfilling lives. Maybe it's selection bias. After all, the  urlLink Chronicle of Higher Education  seems to be a repository of bitching and moaning from humanities students and part-time faculty, presumably because the science grad students and full time faculty have better things to do with their times. The possibility of careers in industy is like a valve that takes some of the pressure out of the academic pipeline for science phd's, but I imagine that physicists, mathematicians, and everyone else interested in basic research are competing for very few spots in academia also. Maybe it's something about the temperment of those drawn to graduate programs in philosophy, history, and the granddaddy of them all, English, that leads to all this agonizing.   Or maybe it is just the reality of the phd program and the job market. One thing I hear a lot about is the pressure to write about the most esoteric and irrelevant topics for your dissertation because it is only on the extreme margins that a lowly grad student with limited funds and time can hope to contribute something new enough to qualify as original research. My favorite professor from college is writing about some really interesting and at least somewhat topical stuff now, but did his dissertation on 'hermeneutics' or some other such word that I can neither spell nor define.   Still, I'm indulging my ivory-tower fantasies for the time being.

      "              Readings   I'm a Democrat. I'm a liberal. And I've been thinking a lot about the shift in the American electorate to the right. One of the most puzzling questions for many liberals is why, since the economic bubble burst, do so many Americans whose economic interests should and have historically aligned with the Democrats continue to support George Bush and the Republicans in increasing numbers. An examination of both present conditions and the explicit economic philosophy of the GOP, or at the very least one's own bank account, should lead people who've suffered because of corporate scandals, de-regulation, job flight, de-industrialization, and regressive taxes to vote Republicans out of office. Instead, the majority of 'Red' Americans (as oppose to 'Blue' Americans), a shorthand for those living in states that went GOP in 2000, love Bush and despise Democrats.  There is quite a bit of literature on this phenomenon. The latest addition is Thomas Frank's article in April issue of  urlLink Harper's ,  Lie Down for America: How the Republican party Sows Ruin on the Great Plains . Frank tells the by now familiar stories of low-income Americans in the heartland 'converting' to the Republican Party from families with long ties to the Democrats dating back to FDR and the New Deal. Like others, including David Brooks in his  urlLink Atlantic  essay from January, 2001, Frank attributes these conversions to cultural rather than economic causes. Red Americans (alas, to think that that term a generation ago invoked something so completely different...) simply 'got sick of being scolded for eating meat or for wearing clothes emblazoned with the State U's Indian mascot.' The liberals, they think to themselves, have gone too far. America needs to go back to its roots, and the people to take here there will be the Red Americans from the heartland, where the traditional values or humility, patriotism, courteousness, and diligence still prevail.   Their response, or backlash, to use Frank's word, was to vote for the socially conservative (instead of progressive), unpretentious (instead of critical) Republicans, whose Platonic Ideal is given human form in George W. Bush.  The tragedy of this response, however, is that these same Republicans haven't delivered on the culture war front. What have done over and over again, is roll back all of the economic controls put in place over the last 60 years, causing the wealth gap to widen to a chasm unprecedented 'in our lifetimes.'   Frank suggests, though does not state outright, that Republicans are merely using the Values talk as a politically potent way to sneak in their economic reforms: '[t]he leaders of the backlash may talk Christ, but they walk corporate.' I don't think this is all a whole lot of hot air. I believe the conservatives try and thankfully fail on the major social issues, in large part thanks to the Court (Gratz v. Bollinger, Lawrence v. Texas, the decision reaffirming Roe whose name I can't be bothered to look up), or at least to four laudable Justices and the odd straggler. The result for Red Americans voting their temper and emotions, however, remains the same: '[v]ote to stop abortion; receive rollback in capital-gains taxes. Vote to make country strong again; receive deindustrialization. [and my favorite!] Vote to screw those politically correct college professors; receive electricity deregulation [and blackouts....]' And so on and so on.  At this point in the article, I'm  totally  stoked to find out what Frank thinks is causing so many Americans to continue to vote against their own best interests, because, let's remember, they're getting screwed economically and they're  not  getting to stick it to those latte-drinking, veggie-eating, tree-hugging, fag-loving, baby-killing, Jesus-hating, graduate-degree-earning Blue Americans.  Sadly, what Frank actually writes is a well crafted deconstruction of the 'myth' of places like Kansas being somehow 'authentically' American. A   deconstruction!!   Well, at least Frank got his Ph.D. at  just  the University of Chicago instead of one of those snobby elite northeastern schools you hear so much about. Fine, so the stereotype of Red Americans as wholesome hard working stiffs is exploded, in part with words like 'vituperate,' and the French  affaire  instead of scandal. I bet you learn words like that in graduate school.  And then Frank moves on to some anecdotal examples of just how the free market has screwed over Kansasians, and we're still left with same question we started with: why are these people voting against their own interests? No, sorry, we're also left knowing that Kansas is, after all, not the mythological place populated with hearty, honest, hard-working Americans who long for honest presidents like Herbert Hoover, or maybe still think they live under Herbert Hoover. But I think few of us believed that to begin with. Yet, I'm no closer to understanding what is causing the radical shift of this country to the right, and all the article left me feeling is a sense of helplessness and inevitability. Indeed, Frank closes his piece with a sentence alluding to a cosmic mandate for the status quo. 'All Kansas asks today is a little help nailing itself to that cross of gold.'   So, I feel pretty sucky after reading this article, as I often do actually after reading anything Harper's, or, for that matter, anything in  urlLink Mother Jones , and much of the rest of the liberal intellectual literature. Of course, I agree with most of what these authors stand for in their politics, but it's still really depressing to be constantly told that there is so much injustice in the world, and worse, that its all here today, because the problems run too deep and the good guys are all too weak and marginalized. Racial inequality in education is so bad that aggressive across the board affirmative action at universities for a whole generation is not enough, and may never be enough. Racism in the use of police power is so pervasive that we as a society cannot be tough on crime without unjustly imprisoning African-Americans. Sexism is so harmful in the workplace that the most casual remarks can lead to a multimillion dollar law suit. Poverty is so crushing that healthy people on welfare can't go back to work full time to 'earn' their pay checks. And the Holy Grail of Helplessness for the intellectual Left: every time you think you're trying to solve a problem you're really actually acting out of some of sub-conscious motivation which is itself shaped by an all-powerful morally agnostic force like Capitalism.  As much as I believe in criticizing what is wrong with the world, and as much as I believe that the statements above are true, too often I get the feeling that its all a lot of shrill whining. Imagine what someone who disagrees the substantive politics must think of liberals!   I agree with Frank that a lot of people probably get turned off by liberals criticizing their lifestyles and beliefs. But maybe it also has to do with the psychologically empowering message being broadcasted by the conservatives: This is your America and it's just fine thank you very much! The only problem we have is all you hyper-critical self-hating liberals going around saying that the sky is falling down.   So let's all forget about our problems, keep the Chicken Littles out of power, and buy bigger bombs with our dwindling pay checks to and drop them people in other countries. See, now they have more problems than we do.          \n",

      "              News   An interesting  urlLink article  in this morning's Times about language and identity in China and Japan. Apparently in Japan there is a law that list the permitted words that parents can use as children's names, presumably so that you don't get the Japanese equivalents of names like  Final , or  Boat , or  [Father's Name] 2.0  (these are real).   The the article also notes that foreign nationals of Japanese ancestry, upon their return to Japan, receive names in the Japanese alphabet reserved for foreign words. This leaves an indelible mark on the identity of overseas- Japanese that adds to their existing though lessening social ostracism in Japan. The author goes on to contrast this phenomenon with the more accepting character of the Chinese to their overseas brethren.   A few thoughts. I wonder what this comparison says about the strength, stability, and cohesion of identity and culture generally for populations in diaspora. It seems like it could go both ways. One can argue that Chinese culture has a stronger sense of Volk because the bonds that hold individuals together survive geographic and generational distance, so that a fourth generation Chinese-American would still be considered 'Chinese' when he goes back to the old country, while a second generation Japanese-Peruvian would instead be considered 'from that country over there.'  But one can also argue that Chinese identity, because it is so malleable and accepting, becomes vacuous or at least significantly diluted for those who were born and have lived abroad. I think the problem of form over substance is particularly acute for the Chinese, who largely do not have the benefits of a home-grown religion or secular equivalent that would serve as a common tradition and set of practices. This absence also make overseas Chinese more susceptible to religious or secular conversion that would further dilute the substance of Chinese culture. Still, it seems that as long as one of the two conditions, ethnicity and geography, is true, then one is considered Chinese.  The bond of soil and identity in the case of the Japanese is more restrictive. Here is a case where culture (or nation, to use a more old-fashioned word) and state do not merely overlap but also seem to define one another. One can be fully Japanese only if one lives in Japan, and one can fully live in Japan (in the psychological sense) only if one were ethnically Japanese.   At the other end of the extreme is the least restrictive bond between identity and geography for citizens of states that are multicultural born and bred - the U.S. and Canada being examples, as oppose to multicultural states that were cobbled together by history - Belgium and Bosnia Herzegovina (and also China) being examples. In the case of the former, identity is contingent upon  neither  ethnicity nor geography. These cultures are far more vulnerable if removed from the mother country precisely because they are so fluid.   It's easy to overlook this aspect now for two related reasons. First, Anglo-American culture is so ubiquitous that one can pretty much find an outpost of it or elements thereof anywhere in the world. Second, the English-speaking countries, of the New World at least, are still very very attractive places to live. But suppose at some point in the future America and Canada become net emigrant countries, and the dominance of McCulture ebbs. By what will the members of an American diaspora define themselves? Language is one possibility; but at the present rate at which English mutates and spreads throughout the world it will likely soon become an even more bastardized tongue than it already is, making it very difficult for 'native' speaks to carve out a strong, discrete identity for themselves based on nuances of language alone.  Political theorists have suggested that liberal civic and political values are sufficient to form the substance of an culture. Jeremy Waldron (25 U. Mich. Law Rev. 757 (1992)) also argues that, in the liberal democracies, there is the advent of a distinct cosmopolitan culture that is more than a shallow overlap of existing cultures and indeed, takes on an identity all to its own.  But cultures by these definitions have serious survivability problems, as they both depend on very fertile sociopolitical environments to exist. (Ironically, Waldron uses his example of the cosmopolitan culture as an argument against state protections of and exemptions for minority cultures, when in fact a cosmopolitan culture is probably the least self-sufficient culture imaginable - try being [to paraphrase Waldron] an English-speaking Aussie who eat Thai food and listens to German opera if everyone around you speaks only Portuguese, has never heard of music with string instruments, and doesn't know what Thai food is.) They require states that are, well, liberal and/or cosmopolitan.   Perhaps the most important function of a culture is to provide meaning and social support for a person, or rather a people of sufficient critical mass, regardless of the external social or political circumstances, provided that they are not overtly and aggressively hostile. It doesn't seem to me that a liberal or cosmopolitan 'culture' is able to provide these things under any but the most ideal conditions.   Everyone can feel a little Irish on St. Patrick's Day when there's an enormous parade marching down 5th Avenue a block from one's office. But one would probably have to  be  Irish to get that same feeling on some dusty bomb-ridden road outside Tikrit.          \n",

      "              Impatiently Waiting   I have about 6 weeks left before I leave my job, hopefully. There are bunch of things to do between now and then, not the least of which is finding someone to take over my apartment. Then there is summer, which I'm very excited about. I also spend a lot of time thinking about starting law school in the Fall, and as lame as it is to say, I can't wait to go.  I've heard a lot of different things about law school. Most of the evaluations range from ambivalence  to downright despair, except from those who are already out and practicing; for them law school was an idyllic time, but I guess that reflects more on being a lawyer than on being a law student. Thoughts about the profession also trouble me, but that's a whole different story.  Despite what I've heard though I'm genuinely looking forward to school. Maybe it's the occasional light-hearted anecdote, like when one young associate at the firm told me about 'Gunner Bingo' tournaments. She made law school sound much less overwhelming than what I've heard form a lot of places, and her refrain 'you go to class, you do the reading, you get a B. It's not heavy lifting' is reassuring. It's also the chance to back on a campus, which offers so many other intellectual and quality of life benefits not found on the outside, very few of them having to do with actual course work, naturally. I want to have time to read again, and to discuss ideas with people who are reading the same things I am. I want to write again, and have topics that interest me and the resources and guidance to help me along. And I want to learn to play squash, and not at a place that has the words 'Yale' and 'Club' in its name.  But I worry too. There are so many people who are a whole lot sharper than I am, and a bunch of others who are probably reading through their 1L course outlines now while still in college, and who will be asking their friends for old exams during the summer - I bet I could guess who these people are from my school. I worry I won't be competitive for all the thing that law-type people go after, like Law Review and appellate clerkships and so on, and I worry that I'll be complacent and just settle on the grades, on the job. I don't think I'd have trouble putting in the work in school, but for every little bit I do a bunch of other people are surely doing a lot more, especially with a class of more than 500 students.   So I'm trying to prepare as much as I can before school, psychologically, and, for lack of a better term I'll call administratively, a.k.a. getting my shit together, (almost) literally. I figure it's best to go in ready to  start all the academic work and not worry about the adjustment and career-related distractions.    But I am going to remain doggedly ignorant of what is actually taught in law school. I don't want to on the wrong side of Gunner Bingo; I want to win those prizes.          \n",

In it he writes about how the Court completely ignored what seems like pretty solid reasoning, and voted based on entrenched property interests. It's not a whining piece though; Lessig concludes that he should have played up the political aspects of the case rather than harp only on the legal minutiae during oral arguments.   In other news , Ulster County in upstate New York has  urlLink charged  a Unitarian minister for performing gay marriages, alleging that he solemnized marriages without licenses. The major of New Paltz, NY was also charged for doing the same.   It's unclear to me why prosecution is a necessary or even effective deterrent in this case. If a state does not recognize gay marriages, then whether or not the clergy perform ceremonies, whether or not they considered the ceremonies 'civil,' as the Unitarian minister apparently did in this case. The civil effects of the ceremony are nonexistent, and no one is going to mistakenly think that all of a sudden gay marriages are legal in the State of New York.    Still, the prosecution probably thought that the whole thing would result in a plea bargain guilty plea, followed by a slap on the wrist. The clergy walk away, and blackletter law triumphs. But, as one might expect, both defendants are planning to litigate the case and probably appeal and appeal when they lose at the trial level, resulting in a repeat in New York of the California gay marriage cases from these past few weeks. This strikes me as a needless waste of court resources and a gratuitous salvo in the culture wars - then again that's probably what the prosecutors were trying to do in the first place.  This case also potentially raises some freedom of religion concerns, since the person performing the ceremonies was not a city employee, as was the case in California and in New Paltz, but a minister. I don't think that there is much of a debate here though, since the minister in this particular instance was clearly performing these ceremonies in the capacity of a public official, as an act of civil disobedience. I can understand the state wanting to reign in its own employees for flouting the law, but that it would go out of its way to harass clergymen (Unitarian no less!) evidences some malicious intent behind the act.                \n",

      "              News   David Brooks's  urlLink Op-ed  in today's Times charges the Spanish electorate with appeasing terrorist the world over by voting the Socialists in to power in Sunday's elections. While Brooks concedes the possibility that unrelated domestic factors actually determined the election, he unambiguously believes that the  perception  of the vote will be that of Spaniards capitulating to terrorists exacting retribution for Spain's support of the United States.  All of this seems at first like egocentric American hysteria. The Popular Party is a right-of-center party, which has traditionally not been in power in Spain's post-Franco history. The government had also fallen out of favor with the electorate as early as a year ago, when there were massive protests against Spain's sending troops to Iraq. One can conclude that the Spanish electorate had plenty of other reasons to be pissed-off with the current government, and that its ousting was an overdetermined event.   Moreover, there is the idea particularly on the Left, that the attacks themselves had nothing to do with Spain's relationship with the United States. One increasingly-incredible view is that ETA was, after all, behind the attacks, and that the Al-Qaeda link is some paranoid American conspiracy theory. Another more nuanced position is that various North African Islamist groups have their own long-standing beef with the Spanish government, which though it may haven been aggravated by the Iraq war, was certainly not predicated on it.  Thus, although these groups may be behind the attacks in Madrid, Americans are wrong to lump the people and motives behind them together with those of Al-Qaeda and its sympathizers.  A couple of things give me pause about these latter two views. The evidence coming in suggest strongly against ETA being the culprit in the attacks. So even if the Al-Qaeda link is a conspiracy theory, it is not a merely American conspiracy theory. In fact, a Socialist  urlLink Deputy  says that the voters were angry with the  government  for trying to blame the ETA for the attacks. The same Financial Times article reports that Spanish political analysts are saying that had ETA been responsible for the attacks, then the Popular Party would have easily won the election, as the polls all along showed they would.   The inference to draw from this information is that, rather than being an overdetermined event, the Socialist victory was a direct and proximate result of the terrorist attacks, believed to be perpetrated by groups linked or sympathetic to Al-Qaeda. So, the Spanish people became, overnight, massively more dissatisfied with their government's foreign and security policy, but why? It seems unlikely that the motivation is simply capitulation out of fear. Rather, one can take the position that Spain's involvement in Iraq is a distraction from the broader fight against extremism and terrorism, and so the Socialists' vocal platform against a continued Spanish presence there would be a stronger rather than weaker stance against terrorism.   But Brooks's argument about perception is still a persuasive one. Even if the people who actually attacked Spain couldn't give a monkey about the United States, Iraq, or for the sake of argument, Islam, it is still true that the correlation of events looks very encouraging to future terrorists, even if (or especially if) their interpretation of the events, like Brooks', mine, and the Spanish electorate's, were totally wrong.   One hopes terrorists are more perceptive and sophisticated.          \n",

      "              Do I Really Want to Read 448 Pages on This?   Alan Wolfe writes a  urlLink review  of Sam Huntington's new book    Who Are We?  in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs.  Apparently, Huntington is now worried not so much about civilizations clashing but rather sneaking across the border and threatening the nice little Anglo-Protestant thing we've got going on in this country. Wolfe's summary of the basic argument is that the new waves of immigration, particularly from non-European countries, is threatening the cultural make-up of the United States with alarming sociopolitical implications. Specifically, the cultural traditions that gave birth to and nurished a dynamic republic that values individual rights and democratic procedures, and to a citizenry that is active in the preservation and extension of these rights and procedures, is jeopardized by a growing population that is at best indifferent and at best apathetic and at worst hostile to these traditions. Moreover, the new waves of immigrants are, unlike their counterparts from generations past, increasingly less susceptible to cultural and political assimilation. The end result of this trend is that the citizens of this country will become less and less patriotic, liberal, and democratic.  Huntington's is not a new argument. Wolfe writes that the sentiments (and indeed they are just that, sentiments, not    reasons   or   data  ) are eerily similar to the nativist bellyaching last heard in the Nineteenth Century. Indeed, Huntington writes that nativism will likely return in force if the immigration trend continues, and especially if the economic downturn continues as well. There are two planks of the nativist argument, one more convincing than the other, but both ultimately flawed.  The first argument is unabashedly selfish. Its premises are that (1) a wealthy country's economy can sustain a certain (comfortable) standard of living for only so many people, (2) people who are already in a country have the right to exclude   all  those who are not already there. What is the justification for the second premise? Is it something as simple as 'I was here first?' This position sounds intutive, and is in line with the Anglo-Protestant tradition mentioned by Huntington. Bruce Ackerman writes what I think is a well-crafted (and funny) response to this position in his   Social Justice and the Liberal State   (1981). Ackerman's point is that unless we reduce a country to be the   private  property of its first inhabiters, a position I don't think even the staunchest of nativists advocate, there can be no justification for excluding immigrants on the basis of who got there first. If timing were really the only justification, then we'd arrive at the perverse conclusion that the children of citizens are in no more favorable position to be granted citizenship than immigrants, since they arguably 'arrive' later than do adult immigrants.  Speaking of which, the last episode of this season's South Park does a very clever take on the whole immigration thing. In the episode, South Park is flooded with 'immigrants' from the future. This is not a techno-savy, Star Trekkie future, but rather a poverty-stricken, labor-glutted, modern-day-developing-country resembling future. These immigrants are quite literally the progeny of the current generation of South Park citizens. In the episode, the citizens of South Park protest against the new immigrants from the future driving down wages and taking every one's jobs. (With this comes the catch-phrase 'They took ahr jahbs!' inspired surely by the now immortal Cartman 'Respect my Ah-thor-eh-Tah!' from the show's early years.') The irony in this episode is that the people of South Park are trying to exclude like foreign immigrants the very same people that navtivists claim to be saving the country for, their own future generations. The characters' ultimate solution to their problem is to try to prevent the future peoples from ever coming into existence. How they try to make this happen is much to profane (and hilarious) to write about here.  The second variant of the nativist argument is more clever is more insidious. It holds that what sets, say, Americans apart from others and what gives current Americans and their children rights to exclude others is not who got here first. Rather, it is the values they hold and the principles they support. The first premise of this argument is that liberal democratic countries are worth preserving and that liberal democratic citizens are preferable to non-liberal, non-democratic citizens for that task. Sounds fine, no argument from me, or from most other liberal I suspect. The second premise is that liberal democracies are dependent on certain values that exist in some but not all cultural traditions, and that these values must be perpetually present in order for the continued existence of liberal democracy. This premise is explicitly opposed to the idea of the Founding Fathers that a virtuous system of government does not need virtuous citizens in order to survive (and the converse that virtuous citizens need not a virtuous system of government). I think most liberals would grant this premise up to a certain point, namely that you'd probably need citizens who were not all overtly and committedtly hostile to ideas like democracy and individual rights. But short of that, people who are not culturally familiar with liberal principles should be fairly easily convinced of liberalism's virtues once they have lived, gone to school, and worked in the United States for some years, and certainly after a generation.  'Ah ha,' the Nativist might say, 'these new immigrants don't associate with the rest of America. They stay in their own linguistic communities wherein the the important values and principles of Anglo-Protestantism can't penetrate.' Part of this is surely true. Now, as before, many immigrants tend to move to little cultural enclaves and live amongst others who share their language, traditions, dress, cuisine and so forth. And this is important and valuable for other peoples as well, for without the critical of distinct cultural communities the broader liberal society would not be able to enjoy the cosmopolitan lifestyle so many claim to cherish.   The phenonmenon of cultural enclaves in the cities and towns of America is certainly not a historical novelty of the late Twentieth Century. Waves of immigrants in the past settled first in the little ethnic neighborhoods in cities like New York, and slowly over the years and generations moved away from the city and into the suburbs (or uptown) where homogeneity is no longer in terms of language or religion but rather by income bracket and motor-vehicle preference.   Moreover, we should consider that all of the previous generations of immigrants assimilated politico-culturally to this country before the availability of the 24-hour news cycle, a dozen cable news stations, and hundreds of Internet sites devoted to civic-ish stuff. The saturation of media in society is at a significantly higher level than it had been at any time in the past, and the invisible walls that separate the enthnic neighborhoods from the broader society are no match for the trumpets of an all-pervasive American Culture.  Without any data beyond some skimpy ones cited by Wolfe on hand, I cannot say that immigrants today are in fact assimilating culturally at a comparable rate as had those in the past. But if in fact Huntington is right, and peoples immigrating to America are less likely to adopt and internalize the important civic virtues that previous generations had, I would submit that perhaps it is not due to some changes in the quantity or quality of those who are seeking a new life here, but rather due to changes in American culture itself.  To list one possible contributing cause, I would observe that media explosion in the last generation has done a great deal to fragment the American identity and American culture. Not only are Americans spending more and more time in front of the television, the video game console, and the computer than they'd ever had in the past, they are also no longer sharing the same experience while doing so. With hundreds of cable channels and scores of websites and newgroups for every possible interest, lifestyle, and viewpoint, each person can now construct a 'community' of sorts that suits his pre-existing values, rather than negotiate these values with a geographically defined and confined community. One effect of this phenonmenon might be that individuals become more self-absorbed and less interested in even listening to the other side, since they have always at their fingertips an existing group who agrees with them. The less exchange there is between groups with different values and opinions, the more tenuous the link between citizens who do not share pre-existing agreement on their conceptions of the good life.  Another possible contributing cause may simply be that the quality of the media has reached a new nadir. Every generation no doubt critcizes its own popular culture when comparing it to some nostalgically conceived impression of popular culture that wasn't so crude and inane. But come on! What passes for news now is pure bullocks. The news media sounds so partisan that it reminds me of what I read about the Federalist and Jeffersonian pamphleteers from the early days of the Republic spewing invectives back and forth. On the right there is jingoistic and moralizing hysteria and on the left there is incoherent paranoid whining. Furthermore, whatever 'serious' news that do vie for our attention along with the Playstation, TiVO, and NASCAR fall into the categories of fear-mongering or cultural wars. It is no wonder that people new to America do not learn to appreciate the true value of American political culture, since this culture seems to manifest itself in only Great Debates over gay marriage and celebrity criminal trials.   So, maybe it's not that immigrants are no longer receptive to American political values, but rather that they took those values all too well to heart: Myself above all others, to hell with   your  beliefs, and entertainment for all!          \n",

      "              Last Day of Work   Got back from Atlanta last night so I could come in today to wrap things up at work, which amounts to piling a bunch of files into boxes and labeling the boxes... so pretty much like what I've been doing for the past month down South.   It is good to know that things are finishing up in Atlanta right now too; I'd hate to have left in the middle of it since that meant other people would have more to do. I've met some really nice people on this trip (and some not so nice... more on this later), and all in all it was a great way to wrap up my 8-month stint on the job. The dreaded Second Request wasn't so bad after all, at least not for those of us who don't have to   review  these documents; that's gotta be painful.  Another thing I've noticed from this trip in working with other firms is how down-to-earth our lawyers are compared to those from some of the big firms. There was one attorney who was perfectly nice and easy-going, but clearly came from serious money. Granted, the sum of my evidence for this claim is his sailing stories at dinner on Wednesday, but then again these were sailing stories set in Newport, RI and the Manhattan Yacht Club. Hmmm. Then there's the one lawyer from L.A. (figures) who brought her little Chihuahua to Atlanta in his own little monographed bag, and then to   dinner   with her firm. She apparently brings this dog to work with her back at the office too.   There was only one lawyer who was actually unpleasant. I don't want to say which firm, but it rhymes with 'Growel & Boring.' Maybe she was so nasty because she's Of Counsel and had to come pitch in at a document pull, something that is from what I can tell reserved for first year associates and peons like myself. But that doesn't excuse a generally rude demeanor and comments like 'I don't care about paralegals,' even in the context of joking with another (in-house) lawyer, and especially when there   is   a paralegal in the same room. To be fair, this little incident is pure hearsay to me, but I trust the source and the attibution to this one particular lawyer does not suprise me.   As for my job in New York, I'm glad to be done to be going back home. Though I know I'm going to have trouble disciplining myself, I'm going to try to spent the vast majority of my free time in May reading, writing, prepping for the GRE's, and excercising. I already have a couple of neat books that I'm aching to start, and a few others I really should finish. There's a strong temptation to go visit all sorts of people in the next month, but I really do want to try to reign in that urge and get some stuff done at home. Ask me how it went when June rolls around.          \n",

      "              Atlanta  I've been in Atlanta for work since last Thurday (with the weekend in between spent in Cambridge), and I should have been writing stuff all along, but have not had time. And it's a shame too, since being in a new environment makes for some good material. But, it's getting kind of late and I'm writing on the hotel's computer, so I'll just make a list of some thought I've had during the week in Powerpointese:  -  If you're ever travelling (-ling?) anywhere on someone else's dollar, stay at W Hotels. They are super-duper nice, if you can get over the whole dance-club/lounge style they've got going on.  - Despite being a fairly large and vibrant metropolis, Atlanta is still oh so very conservative compared to the North. I just noticed that the TV in the break area of the floor we're working on at the client site is always on Fox News. At first I thought people were just too lazy or didn't know how to change the channel; but it's only recently occurred to me that they actually   agree  with the nonsense spewed forth from the mouths of Fox's anchormen.  - NBA basketball is a lot slower in person. For some reason, the television makes the court look really large compared to the players, or it could be that you don't get a sense of how large the players really are on TV, but the court looks puny live. For context, I had really good searts to the Hawks-Sixers game last night, courtesy of the client, and for a meaningless game between two less-than-mediocre teams it was suprisingly competitive towards the end. The game was decided in overtime on the final shot, which was, albeit, a miss.  - There's a whole lot of gender segregation in the law business. And I guess this should come as no surprise to me, and I did notice it when I first started working at the firm I'm with now, but being here with two other much larger firms really highlights this point. Of the ten 12 support staff working on this matter between the three firms I am one of three guys, and the other two are both senior to the majority of the women, who make up the bulk of the peon-workforce, it seems. And I guess this makes sense in a twisted sort of way, since men are invariably more comfortable giving direction to women than to other men (except in a military setting, I suppose...).   - I've also noticed, now that I have some method of comparison, how efficient my firm is compared to some other, not-unprestigious places. They have a lot of expertise we don't, I think, but in terms of personnel, we have so many fewer inefficiencies, in part because we simply have fewer people, but also because we don't seem to have the kind of people who are really shirkers. This is particularly true when it comes to support staff, and I imagine at large firms it's almost always the case that some support workers get hammered with time, and other seem to get away with doing nothing most of the time; but I guess this is true in every kind of office. Somehow, though, the deadwood do things to try to seem useful, like wasting 45 minutes of everyone's time with a meeting spent drawing diagrams and coming up with acronyms for things like 'desk' and 'credenza' and 'rear desk.'   - I finished a short monograph on the work of Alistair MacIntyre, which actually helped a lot for my understanding of some of his major ideas. What I'm not so clear on, and on which I think the author did a poor job, was with both the criticism of MacIntyre work and the responses to them. I'd write something here to make this little tidbit at least somewhat useful, but I felt bad about writing comments in the margins of a library book, and so I forgot much of what I thought when I was reading it.  - It's really pretty tough to find good conversation even when one is surrounded by not-unintelligent people. The problem might be that a lot of people are relucant to have discussions that smack of intellecutualism because it comes off as pretentious, or for fear that it offends someone's political or religious or whatever sensibilities. Still, I'm looking forward to going back to school if just to have a forum where people can talk about ideas without worrying about these matters of manners as much.  Will write more stuff tomorrow, unless I go to the baseball game, gotta love the corporate seats.          \n",

      "              Road Trip and Wildlife   I'm en route to North Carolina (again) today, after having driven up to Cambridge from Long Island on Friday and then back down yesterday.   It's really nice to be in warm weather again, and I kept telling myself throughout this past winter that I will move to some warmer climate in the future. But the return of summer has also brought the return of bugs, and I do not react well immunologically to bug bites; specifically, I develop enormous, painful welts from the most ordinary of bites. So, I think I may have to reconsider the benefits of living in colder climates, where Nature in its parasitic glory isn't so prominent.  I'm starting to get a trickle of pictures in from my digital camera, so hopefully I will figure out how to post pictures online.

      "              'Who Took My Flag?!'   I'm going to a wedding at the end of August; my first wedding ever, and it also happens to be my first lesbian wedding ever. It'll take place in a suburb of Boston, and it's of two middle-aged women who've been together for the past decade. They lived together for some years, although only one partner's name is on the deed of the house, and without marriage the other would not have any survivor's rights. Similarly, neither one can leave their jobs to explore other career opportunities because other cannot include her on a company health insurance plan. These material benefits, plus the psychological though perhaps more important benefits of recognition, will be available to them finally in just a few short weeks. Luckily for them, they are residents of Massachusetts. The countless other same-sex couples who wish to get married in their home state cannot do so, and, thanks to Governor Mitt Romney's decision to dig up an anti-miscegenation law from 1913, cannot do so in Massachusetts either. Never mind that the law's blindingly obvious intent was to enforce the martial Jim Crow laws of the southern states. Apparently this reprise of legislative hideousness doesn't phase the governor one bit.  The thing that surprises me about the zealousness of the opposition to same-sex marriage is exactly the lack of zealousness about   anything else   in most of its members. Were the entirety of the lobby made up of the staunch Christian Right, who are also vocally and politically pro-life, anti-death penalty, anti-divorce, anti-single parenting, anti-sex, and anti-puppies, then this whole thing would make sense. After all, it is understandable that some people have certain fundamental principles, no matter how unpleasant they may be, whose violation they will not tolerate. But the majority of Americans, thankfully, do not fall into this category. Sure, it seems likely that these days the majority of the country, or at least of the voting electorate, are leaning right instead of left. Yet there is a huge gap between people who are sympathetic to the (fruit)basket of conservative policies and those who would bring about political mayhem in all three branches of government, just to prevent ten percent of the population from using a word to describe their romantic relationships. (Polls consistently show that the majority of the country support full legal rights for same-sex civil unions, as long as those unions do not involve the word 'marriage').   What on earth makes this issue so important to so many in this country? What interest can heterosexual individuals possibly have in preventing their homosexual countrymen from marrying one another? The only interest that has been articulated, and I hesitate to use that word, is some half-baked notion about how same-sex marriages will erode the idea, and as a result, the practice of the 'traditional' family - presumably a husband, a wife, 2.5, 1.8 mistresses, a cat, a dog, and a  mortgage problem. But this argument is so nonsensical and inane that I find it hard to believe that people actually buy it. Yet it's understandable that people continue to spout it. One can hardly think of a more frightful impact than the dissolution of the American Family, and with it the end of procreation, because either everyone will 'turn gay,' or the children raised by weird non-traditional families will be dangerously antisocial anyway (because, alas, they won't have dad's alcoholic fits and mom's passive-aggressive sabotages from which to learn proper behavior). There is a certain percentage of the country that believes this story. In their minds, they have a real stake in this matter, because if they lose, then, well, the world might as well end. But they can't possibly make up the majority. There is also a large contingent of much more reasonable individuals out there who oppose same-sex marriage, even though they have no interest, so to speak, in that matter.  Why are these people, these slightly right of middle Americans, so opposed to a policy change than hurts no one and helps so many? Ariel made the interesting point that many of these individuals do in fact have a personal stake in preventing same-sex couples from the same kind of recognition afforded to heterosexuals. Were same-sex marriages to be recognized in this country, people quickly see that the world will not end as a result, and that homosexuals are different from heterosexuals in only superficial and politically and morally irrelevant ways. With this dawning realization, the still extant and often crushing stigma attached to being gay will slowly begin to lift. And then guess what happens? A whole lot of fathers, mothers, grandparents, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, cousins, daughters, and, gasp!, sons will begin to come out of the closet. An then won't it be humiliating for all those who now see homosexuality as at best something gross and weak, and at worse a mortal sin. So it is the fear of exposure, and the fear of the resulting embarrassment and ostracism that motivates those who have no other interest in opposing same-sex marriage to take their stance. This motive is much more base than those who motivate the true believers mentioned above. Those people do what they do because they believe it is a matter of right and wrong or life and death. These people are merely afraid of being shamed, in their own eyes and  in the eyes of their social cliques.  At first I thought that the fear motivation didn't make any sense, because it is a self-denying prophecy. If it came to be that same-sex marriages were recognized throughout the country, and homosexuality sheds all of its remaining social handicaps, then there would be nothing left to be embarrassed about even if one's son or mother finally comes out of the closet. In other words, the sequence of events leading to the negative result to happen necessitate the results to become no longer negative. But then it occurred to me that while this process may be true at the level of national popular sentiment, it is not true for each individuals. An interesting thing about major shifts in popular sentiment, especially those concerning taboo issues, is that people rarely think beforehand that they will be part of those who change their minds. As a result, people in the obstinate majority can't ever imagine that they (or people like them) will change their own minds, but they can very well imagine that other people (and isn't the 'liberal elite' the ultimate 'other' in American cultural politics?) will change their minds and bring about the catastrophic result. Hence the siege mentality, and hence the fervor in their opposition to same-sex marriage.   The couple whose wedding I am attending had for some time now an American flag with the rainbow colors hanging from the front of their house. A few nights ago, some people, kids presumably, stole the flag. It doesn't take a lengthy and rambling argument to explain their behavior. They were simply immature kids - jerks and bullies, who liked to pick on those who are different, and socially less powerful than they are. Maybe I've been thinking too hard about a rational explanation for the rabid and senseless bigotry against same-sex marriage. It could just be the case that the people who thoughtlessly oppose it just get a kick out of being bullies and jerks.   Don't we all want to be young again?          \n",

      "              Back from the Beach   I spent the last few days on the Outer Banks, in North Carolina, a very nice little area a few miles out in the Atlantic, full of summer homes and sand and stuff. I flew down on Monday after my GRE's.  The exam itself went pretty poorly. The test was much harder than any of the practice tests I did on both paper and computer from the GRE's own prep software. The issues essay topic was its usual banal statement; but the argument essay was pretty interesting, a mini-debate about environmental policy. The experimental section was a math section, that was super hard. The scored math section was more reasonable. The verbal was what did me in, the vocab itself wasn't hard in the sense of being words I'd never heard of, but rather just plain difficult in the logic between the words (in the case of analogies) and the specific usages (in the cases of antonyms). I guess this is the way they would ideally give the test, so that people are tested partially on their dictionary-understanding of vocabulary, but mostly on their ability to understand the use the words in their vocabulary, which I didn't do so well.   In any event, the test is over now, and the applications await. I can hope only that my writing scores will be good, because I scored much lower on the verbal than I did on the math, not so good when one is applying to a social science grad program. To be fair, the graduate admissions process bears barely a family resemblance to the undergraduate and law school processes. A high GRE, unlike a high LSAT, would not really help my chances. But I'm not certain that a low GRE won't   hurt   my chances. I should get the writing score in a week or so. Will revisit this subject on the blog at that point.           \n",

      "              This Post is Not Very Professional   'Two professionals in their 20s seek professional M or F roommate in his or her 20s for 3BR share.'  I remember seeing a bunch of ads like this when I looked for an apartment last year, and again when I looked to rent my place last month. As a matter a fact, I posted something very similar to that in my own  urlLink Craigslist  ad. It seemed that every other post used the word 'professional' to describe either the current inhabitants or the desired additions. But what exactly is a professional?  I always thought that, when used as a noun, professional refers to a person employed in, well, a profession. And it used to be that there were about as many recognized professions as you can count on your hand. There were the doctors, the engineers, the lawyers, the, uh... embalmers, and, well, the contract killers. In order to be a professional, you had to have been traded in these practices, went to some sort of school, and earned some kind of degree. Are teachers professionals? Traditionally I think they have been excluded, but I saw on the local news last night an interview at an elementary school with some woman whose title was 'paraprofessional.' The implication of this designation is that the teachers themselves are professionals. In any event, teachers are closer to the narrow definition of the term than investment bankers, consultants, and managers. But now it seems that in order to be a professional, you just need to be employed as anything higher up the workplace food chain than a corner spotter for the local crack deal (the crack dealer himself is, of course, a professional). So I guess we should probably call the spotter a paraprofessional.  Another use of the word that kind of strikes me happens in sentences like this one, 'Tie your shoes and get rid of that mustard stain on your shirt; you want to look professional.' I'm not sure if this is a sufficiency or necessity statement. Does having tied shoes make one a professional? Or does having untied shoes make one not a professional. Obviously what the statement is trying to communicate is the importance of looking like you're serious about whatever business situation your entering, so as not to give the other side the impression that they're dealing with some careless or dirty person. But I don't see why the word professional got impressed into the doing the shorthand work in this instance. What is needed is a word that conveys the meaning of looking like something within the broad range of 'impressive' to 'passable.'   After all, that is how we use it all the time now. 'Make this presentation look more professional.' (Translation: 'Make it prettier, with darker colors and fancy marble-patterned designs.') It's a PowerPoint presentation. You don't need professional training to make or understand powerpoint; and if you had it, you'd probably lose it from making mind-numbing slides anyway. 'You should act more professionally at meetings.' (Translation: 'Don't use non-standard English associated with ethnic minorities. Don't gesticulate like you're pistol-whipping someone. Wear a suit, preferably one without any logos on the lapels.')   I suppose the meaning of the word professional is well-understood enough, even if it is so vague as to approach meaninglessness. Still it kind of bothers me that so many people are encroaching on the word. I'm going to complain to my Member of Parliament, or maybe just write a letter to  urlLink Barbara Wallraff  and she what she says.           \n",

      "              Historical Materialism and the Long Island Rail Road   I don't even know what that title means, but I thought some Marxist jargon would be a good way to start off a post about economic and social injustice - sort of. I took the LIRR home today after picking up my visas from the Chinese consulate in New York (more on this in a bit). There was a little pamphlet on every seat which looks like it's some sort of newsletter from the railroad. On the back there is a little table called 'On-Time Monthly Performance,' showing the percentage of trains that run on time, defined as arriving within 6 minutes of the scheduled time, for each of the LIRR's 11 commuter lines.  Something about the table was interesting. The Port Washington line, which carries passengers to and from suburbs that can be categorized in the fairly well-off to very well-off range, ran on time 94.5 percent of the time. The Ronkonkoma line, which carries passengers to and from suburbs that can be categorized in the not-so-well-off range, arrived on time only 87.8 percent of the time. Now, in fairness, the Ronkonkoma line is a much longer line, so there are arguably more stops along the way at which delays could arise. But surely the railroad takes this factor into account when it builds the time table, and add in the buffer minutes accordingly. So I would guess that the delays are above and beyond the already budgeted delay times.   Still, Ronkonkoma is much father to go from New York than Port Washington. So I looked at the performance for the Montaulk line, which runs from Penn Station all the way out to the end of the southern fork of Long Island, much farther east then Ronkonkoma. It also happens that the Hamptons lie along the Montaulk line, so one can imagine the clientele for this service. Surprise, surprise, the Montaulk line arrived on time 94.03 percent of the time.   It seems that working class folks living en route to Ronkonkoma are 7 percent more likely to spend needless time waiting for the train than the upper-middle class folks living en route to Port Washington, or the super wealthy people playing en route to Montaulk. But that's ok, because those people's time are worth less anyway, so they might well spend it sitting in a train, or standing on an open-air platform in the middle of winter.   Now the Communists, for all they did wrong, at least they made the trains run on time. Wait, that's the what the Italians said of the fascists. But if there were trains delays under communism, at least they would be equal for all the people.  Speaking of the train to the Hamptons, the newsletter I found today also has a section about the special 'Hampton Reserve' trains that run during the summer. These are special Friday afternoon trains that, apparently, take reservations, and have attendants who 'serve[] beverages and snacks during your trip to the Hamptons/Montaulk.' I don't know if you've ever taken the LIRR, but I've never had an attendant serve me anything, except the occasional surely attitude (no, I'm kidding; they're all in fact exceptionally nice). But, I suppose if you have to suffer through a train ride to the Hamptons instead of a nice jet or chopper ride, you might as well have people wait on you during the trip.   Maybe if the people on the Ronkonkoma line had people serving them drinks and snacks, they wouldn't mind the extra delays.           \n",

      "              Rubbish in Real Time II  5 more days until the exam, and I want to do at least two more essays. So I'll start the clock on this one at 10:30AM.   Issue Essay: 'To truly understand your own culture - no matter how you define it - requires personal knowledge of at least one other culture, one that is distinctly different from your own.'   The term culture encompasses a set of values, rituals, and codes of behavior shared by a particular group of people. Within this group, these aspects make up one's entire life experience from birth to death, such that they become routine. Culture includes the language we speak and when and how it is spoken; it includes a set of religious or non-theistic ethical principles that governs our daily lives, and it includes the rules guiding all social interactions. We can practice our culture without being aware that there could be other ways of living our lives, since it could be the only thing we've ever known. Thus, in order for each person to truly understand his own culture, he needs to have personal knowledge of at least one other culture whose rituals, codes, and values are distinctly different from those of his own.  To understand something requires at the very least some knowledge about what that thing is, how it has come to be, and why it is that instead of something else. When applied to culture, understanding requires knowledge of a different culture in order to compare and contrast the basic elements of each. Without knowledge of another culture, we would not even know that ours is, in fact, a culture that is one of a set of many different and distinct cultures. Similarly, if we had no knowledge of other celestial bodies we would not know that the earth is but one of many objects in the universe, and thus not have an understanding of what the earth truly is.   Secondly, knowing another culture allows us to understand the origins of our own culture. Origins in this case does not mean the founding myths of a culture, which surely every one has. Rather, it means the historical conditions which gave rise to the parricular set of ideas, practices, and values that made up this culture instead of another one. For example, an island nation in tropics will likely have developed a different type of culture than a land-locked nation in the desert. In order to understand how one's own culture originated, one has to know about the origins of another culture in order to think about how differing conditions and circumstances impacted the development of each. It is only with this knowledge that culture are shaped by causal factors, and are not simply how things are naturally done, that we can understand our own culture.  Thirdly, and perhaps most important, one needs to know about another culture in order to appreciate what is valuable in his own culture. Without knowledge of how one's own culture could be different and what that experience might be like, one cannot really understand the experience of living in one's own culture. For example, a person growing up in a culture that values individualism and personal expression would not truly know why those two qualities of the culture are valuable, as that person has never experienced living in a culture that supressed or outright rejected those qualities. Knowledge of another culture's values and practices offers a different perspective from which one can learn to appreciate certain aspects of one's own culture. Conversely, knowledge of another culture's practices allows each person to see what might more preferable in that other culture. To reuse the earlier example, someone from an individualistic society might find beneficial the emphasis on social cooperation and mutual assistance in another culture. Knowledge of a different way of living life forms the impetus for us to change what we do not like in our own ways of living.   Lastly, the knowledge one has to have of another culture, unlike the knowledge one might have about other plants, needs to be personal knowledge. Personal knowledge is necessary for two reasons. First, we each experience our own culture in slightly different ways, so that it is crucial that we can compare our own interpretation of our culture with another. Thus the comparison requires personal knowledge. Second, the same observations of a different culture will result in different opinions and understandings in each different person. When we look through a telescope, we all see the same Juipter. Such is not the case when examining another culture. One cannot rely on someone else's knowledge of a different culture in order to compare and contrast, just as one cannot rely on someone's else's experience of one's own culture in order to do the same.  Culture and its component values, rituals, and codes of behavior guide almost every aspect of our lives. Since it is omnipresent in any given cultural group, one needs personal knowledge of another, distinct culture, in order to gain a prospective from which one can begin to understand one's own culture. It is through this knowledge of how life could be lived differently, that one can come to understand what it means to live life that way one does.   Argument Essay  The newsletter to investors contains one main conclusion based on two supporting conclusions. The main conclusion is that investors who own the stock should sell their shares of Old Dairy Industries, and that investors who do not own the stock should not buy it. This advice is based on two conclusions: first, that results of a recent survey reflect an actual trend that consumers will buy less high fat and cholesterol foods in favor of lower fat and cholesterol varieties; second, that as a result of this possible shift in behavior, Old Dairy Industries' profits will decline. The author's faulty analysis of the information given and his neglect of possible contradicting information both undermine the main conclusion of the argument.  The cited survey results indicate only what the surveyed consumers said they would do. The author does not indicate the source of the survey nor the selection process of the respondents. It could be the case that the survey was given as part of a medical research process examining patients with heart disease, in which case there would be a strong sample bias against high fat and cholesterol foods, and would not reflect what consumers in general want to do. Moreover, the survey results indicate only what the respondents said they would 'desire' to do, not what they actually have begun to do. There is no empirical evidence showing a downturn in the sales of high fat and high cholesterol foods, without which it is premature to believe that consumers will actually behave differently when they are shopping. Given these two analytical flaws, one should not conclude that the survey results are reflective of actual, broad-based consumer behavior.  The author's second supporting conclusion is also problematic. It infers from the questionable conclusion that consumers will buy less high fat and cholesterol foods to conclude that the sales and profits of Old Dairy Industries will 'diminish greatly,' because that company markets many products that are high in fat and cholesterol. However, before one can soundly make that inference, one needs several other pieces of information, which the author of the newsletter does not provide.  First, it is necessary to know whether or not Old Dairy Industries also markets other, low fat and cholesterol foods. If it does, then there is reason to believe that a shift in consumer behavior will not hurt, and will possibly help, the company's bottom line, since those who stop buying one product from the company will start buying another.   Second, there is no information whatsoever provided on what types of high fat and cholesterol foods the consumers will actually stop buying. Not all high fat and cholesterol foods are created equal. Some, like potato chips and other processed foods, provide no nutritional benefits and can probably be readily replaced in a person's diet. Others, like milk, are essential to many people's diets and will be more difficult to replace even if it contains high far and cholesterol. If the kinds of products that Old Dariy Industries markets are more like the latter kind, then even a general decline in the sales of high fat and cholesterol foods are unlikely to greatly impact this particular company's sales.  The newsletter's advice is that investors should sell and avoid stock in Old Dairy Industries. This advice, however, is given based on unsound conclusions drawn from sketchy data and faulty inferences. One should not conclude from an unnamed survey that the respondents' answer, in the absence of supporting data, will reflect general consumer behavior. Furthermore, one should not conclude that a shift in general consumer purchase patterns away from high far and cholesterol foods will hurt Old Dairy Industries. There is no information on the types of high fat and cholesterol products it makets, nor on what other types of products it markets. Both these factors could allow Old Dairy Industries to protect itself against, if not even profit from, a possible change in consumer purchasing behavior.           \n",

      "              Rubbish in Real Time   The GRE exam as of last year added a new section called 'analytical writing,' which includes an issues essay and an argument essay. The issues essay reminds me of the SAT II Writing essay component, where the exam makes some cliche and you're suppose to write about that somehow. Like, 'The squeaky wheel gets the grease,' or 'there are too many specialists in society today at the cost of more generalists.' The latter was the sample issue given by the GRE people. Since you're allowed to interpret the issue in any way, I thought about writing on how relievers in baseball are becoming too specialized to do one thing, like get some specific player out. But then I realized that was stupid. The argument essay sounds more interesting. That's where the exam presents certain facts and then draws a conclusion from these facts through a series of inferences, some valid, others not so much. We're suppose to write an essay assessing the strength of the argument, and I imagine that in 99.999% of the cases, the test-taker is suppose to attack the argument.   Since the exam is in exactly 7 days, I thought I should start writing some practice essays, even though I always hate doing that. Practice questions, I'll do a ton, but the essays are just so boring to write. So, to make the practice experience a bit more real for myself, I thought I'd write the on the blog, in real time, and post the results without any more editing than I would have at exam time (not that I ever edit any of the stuff that's on here).   So, it is now 1:05PM, I will begin my first essay when it hits 1:07.   Issue Essay: All students should be required to take courses in the sciences, even if they have no interest in science.   The purpose of an education is to impart knowledge on students that they should have, both so that they can function properly in society, and so they can appreciate the value and meaning of their own lives. Often times, this education will include subjects that at first appear esoteric and irrelevant to daily life, especially to younger children. Nonetheless, it is precisely when children are at that earlier age that they are most receptive to new knowledge, even if they do not realize or appreciate that at the time. Therefore, school curricula should focus on teaching what the students what is important regardless of the students professed interest in the topic. One such topic is the body of knowledge about the natural world collectively called the sciences: physics, chemistry, and biology. It is particularly important that students are educated in the sciences during elementary and high school. Once at the college level, students, if they have received a quality science eduationa already, should be allowed to choose their own classes. Although even at that level, there should be broad distributive categories, one of which needs to be science, and within which they need to take one or a few classes.  There are two main ways in which a science education is important and indeed essential for students. The first is in terms of the content they learn through such an education. This content itself can be divided into practical knowledge and aesthetic knowledge. Science is about understanding the world around us, but it can also be in certain cases about manipulating or controlling it. To build a car requires an understanding of physics and the interaction of forces; to invent medicine requires an understanding of human and molecular biology and the interaction of chemicals. All of technology, and the improvement is has on our lives, would be impossible within the basic science that grounds it. Just as science allows us to control our world, it also allows and compels us to protect it. Without an understanding of biology and geology among others, we would not appreciate the importance of preserving the environment around us, or even if we did, we would not know how to protect that environment. Thus, in order to continue to maintain and expand our practical and technological use of science, we should as a society ensure that our students are educated in those sciences.   Beyond its practical uses, the content of scientific knoweldge is also valuable in an aesthetic way. To know how the world works offers us not only the ability to shape it to our uses, but also to marvel at its beauty and elegance. The bulk of scientific research has always been directed at knowledge for its own sake rather than for ways we can exploit it for technological innovation. Students should be taught the sciences so that they can continue in this tradition, and so that they themselves can appreciate the wonders of our earth and of our universe.   The second main way in which a scientic education benefits students is how it shapes our practice of acquiring knowledge. Students in high school and particularly in elementary school are just beginning to learn how we learn things, and what is the proper way to learn things. The scientific method and its focus on evidence and logic impart and enforce lessons on learning itself. Without an education in the sciences, students will not know what it means for a fact to be true, and we risk losing them to superstituions and pseudo-science. Science also teaches students to think for themselves and no simply accept what others tell them as the truth. One of the main requirements of the scientific method is that all experiments be readily replicable, so that people can always go back and test any claim or theory. A science education teaches students how they can themsevles acquire and create knowledge for the rest of their lives.   Once students have graduated from high school with a solid grounding in the sciences, they should have some latitude in choosing their own courses in college. At the college level, most students have some idea of what it is they are interested in studying, and so the cost of extra classes in the sciences is time they do not have for other classes. Moreover, to force students to take many classes in sciences, particularly sciences in which they have no interest, encourages students not to take those classes seriously. However, some flexible distributive requirement should be in place that allows students to choose one science class from a variety. That way, students can take classes on what they want to continue to learn in college.   Argument Essay  The argument made by the author of the newspaper article is threefold: first, that the fitness level of the citizens of Corpora have actually gone down compared to that of tweny years ago; second, that computers are definitively not the cause of that downturn; and third, that the decline in the economy is most likely the cause. However, all three of the authors claims rest on faulty logic and questionable assumptions, and the state of the health of Coropora's citizens is likely much more complex.  First, the author uses the fact that only a quarter of the citizens meet the national advisory board's standard in physical fitness today compared to half of the population twenty years ago, we do not know if the standards used by the national advisory board is the same now as it was then. If in fact the standards have changed, then it is very possible that the citizens are just as fit today as they were tweny years ago, even though more of them no longer measure up to the news standards.  Second, the author draws a questionable inference from the fact the computer ownership level is highest where the fitness level is also highest to eliminate computer use as a possible cause of lower fitness levels. There could be other factors in the lives of those people that make them more fit than others. For example, ownership of computers suggests higher education and possibly higher income than non-ownership. Perhaps some other aspect  of the lifestyles of the segment of the population that has high computer ownership levels affect their fitness level. In that case, the amount of time spent in front of a computer can have direct impacts on one's fitness level., People have computers but not sufficient income will receive the negative effects of usage, and they would not have the means or time to exercise or eat well to counteract those effects.  Regardless of the relationship between computers and fitness, there is no reason to believe, as the author claims, that there is any relationship between the economy and spending on fitness products and services on the one hand, and the level of fitness in the population on the other hand. One's fitness is something that changes slowly over the course of years, and a decrease in spending on equipment or services for one year is unlikely to cause a large percentage of the population to become less healthy. Many types of fitness-related products are long lasting, like a pair of running shoes or a basketball, which are unlikely to be rendered useless by a temporary slump in the economy. Furthermore, the article mentions only that the fitness level this year is low, and not when it became this low. Thus, we do not know if the fitness level of the population changed during the downturn in the economy.  Finally, the author fails to consider several possible long-term changes that could have impacted the overall fitness-level of the population. The comparison is made, after all, between the level from tweny years ago and those from today. Much can change in the population in an entire generation. For example, we do not know if the economy of Corpora has changed dramatically from, say, an agricultural one to an industrial one. Such a change could certainly have a  negative impact on the fitness-level of Corpora's citizens. There could also have been changes in the population density, moving a less dense setting with space for exercise and better air quality to a more dense setting with less space and worse air. Changes in the daily habits of the population beyond computer-use are much more likely to affect that population's fitness level than temporary changes in the economy. If people started eating less healthy food or drove more to work instead of walked, the fitness level would decrease, and neither of these causes has much to do with the recent economic changes.          \n",

      "              Book Review   I just finished Donald Antrim's novella,  urlLink Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World , and I quite liked it. The story is set over the course of a few days in what would seem like an ordinary suburb in some tropical coastal part of the United States. But readers quickly finds out that the town has descended into a Hobbesian chaos of fear and violence, started by what we learn was the ex-mayor's launching of should-held Stinger missiles in the park, which results in the death of several civilians and ultimately in the mayor's drawing and quartering by a fleet of mid-range sedans.   The rest of the story is equally saturated with violence, from neighborhood blood-feuds fought out in a land-mined park to lethal home defense systems surrounding every house. Yet, the mood of all of the characters in the story is probably best described as ordinary. The only problem that seems to bother people is the recent demise of the town school system, which the narrator, Pete Robinson, is trying to salvage in the form of a home school in his own house. Pete, a former history teacher with a fascination with medieval torture devices, oversees a grim disaster on the first day of classes in his new school, near the end of the book.  A very thin but omnipresent veneer of civility covers all the adult characters in the book. Despite the madness going on around them, the citizens of this town seem stuck in suburban bourgeois behavior and interaction modes. Though we are privy to the thoughts of only Pete Robinson, it is likely that the other adults share the same kind inner monologue that, though it does not ignore the reality, mold it into recognizable stories of causes and effects.   The children, on the other hand, adapt much more completely and openly to the new environment of a suburban jungle (and the jungle imagery appears repeatedly in the form of the no-man's-land of a park). An older child and former A-student Ben Weber devolves into Rambo-like warriors living only to avenge the death of his father, killed by the hated Benson clan. And Pete's best response to Ben's state is to invite him to guest teach at the new school on outdoor survival strategies. The younger children were, until the end of the book, sheltered from this reality in their own homes behind the moats and death pits. The irony is that it is with the opening of the brand new school, with all of its promise of teaching kids to make the town more civil (the mantra of the new school was 'Diversity, Tolerance!'), is what actually lead the kids to emulate the most horrific act of violence in the entire book.   I'm not sure what this book is commentary on, if it is a commentary on anything. Some reviewers on Amazon.com have expressed with displease that it is merely rehashing the by-now banal point that suburbia sucks. I don't think it's just about the effects of suburban life. The story would have been equally absurd and effective if it had taken place in an urban setting (indeed within a single apartment building). What is interesting is the sub-plot in the story that seems totally extraneous, namely the strange self-hypnosis technique that allow people to live briefly as if they were some kind of animal, an animal each person apparently just find himself to be. Most of the characters in the book are sea creatures; Pete seems to be the exception as a plains Buffalo. That, combined with the setting of the story (near the beach) and the constant physical reminders of the ocean (Pete's wife Meredith's shell necklace) surely have something to do with the social anarchy of the town. I don't know what this connection is. Maybe it's the author drawing a parallel between the return to primitive society in the town and the psychological return to existence as the most primitive organisms on earth, those that lived in the ocean. Who knows.   But regardless of its weirdness and possible depth (or maybe it's in spite of? or because of?), the book is a very comical if macabre read. And quick too, just the way I like 'em.  Speaking of a funny, macabre, and quick read, I would strongly recommend  urlLink Death and the Penguin , by Andrey Kurkov. This book is not so violent at all, and is a very charming and indeed sweet story about friendship... with a penguin, named Misha.           \n",

      "              Funny List    urlLink Harper's Magazine  has a collection of random funny media clippings each month in a section called 'Readings.' The June issue has a list taken from a post on armywives.com about the things you can do to feel like you were actually deployed on the Front. It is very, very funny, but I couldn't find the original posting on the web site, so I'll  urlLink link  to another blog whose author has taken the time to transcribe most of the list.  My favorite from the list:  'Go to the most crime-infested place you can find, heavily armed, wearing a flak jacket and a Kevlar helmet. Set up shop in a tent in a vacant lot. Announce to the residents that you are there to help them.  The rest of it list are clever but fairly mundane pokes at the various follies of military bureaucracy and at the harsh and often irrational inconveniences of life on the Front. But the one above makes it seem that the person who wrote it has a more fundamental problem with the overall mission in Iraq, and not just with ther operational stupidities of the military. The idea that an armed occupation is good for building civility and self sufficiency seems all the more ludicrous when reduced to the reality of entailing groups of armed men to stare warily at one another. I wonder who posted the list in the first place. Armywives.com itself looks like something cobbled together by, well, army wives. It's mood is, as one may expect, heavily patriotic. But it's good to know there is a healthy amount of dissent in the military caste.           \n",

      "              Let's All Go Out to the Movies   Just got back from seeing 'Troy' at the theatre nearest here, which is actually about 10 miles away. Overall I thought it was a good movie, kinda like 'Gladiator' in terms of production value and feel; but 'Gladiator' had a much stronger cast, I thought. The producers changed a great deal in adapting the screenplay from the  Iliad  , and instead of ending with the burial of Hector, the film ends with the fall of the eponymous city. I never read the Iliad, nor am I that familiar with the Greek stories, but I suspect that there are plenty of allusions that I didn't get throughout the film to works other writers who had chronicled the Trojan War. The one allusion I did get was towards the end, when Paris gives a sword to a teenager named Aeneas who is  escaping the city, and tells him to found a new Troy. So, people who know more than I do about classis will probably get a little more out of the film than I did.  Tonight was also the first time in a very long while that I've been to the movies on the weekend night, and the first time that I've ever done so in a suburban mall. I don't think I've ever seen so many high school students at the movies, or at anything else besides school; it was really quite a sight.   Also, the new template for this blog doesn't seem to be legible on my old PC with a pretty old version of Netscape, and I wonder if this problem happens on other computers. If it does, post a comment about it.     No More Raven Burgers for Me...?   Recent  urlLink research into animal cognition  suggests that some birds may have a more advanced 'theory of mind,' or knowledge of the existence of other minds, than we'd previously thought. This short Economist story summarizes the findings of two researchs' work on Ravens, including a test of the birds' ability to follow the gaze of a human, and their ability to learn to deceive one another.  I don't think this means that birds are now substantially smarter than we thought they were, and I do recall something from the behaviorist section of my Psych 1 class talking about some B.F. Skinner experiments from the 50's that showed birds learning to deceive each other. Apparently their success confirmed Skinner's theory that all of cognition and seemingly complex social beharior was really just conditioned rule-following, and that even birds can be conditioned to follow scaled-down but recognizable 'scripts' of human interaction.  I wished I'd paid more attention in that class.          \n",

      "              Three Pieces of Unrelated News   In general, I don't keep abreast of current events, and shamefully I try hard to keep it that way. News often depresses me. Not the kind of random murder-rape-and-rampage nonsense you get on the local news, but 'real' news about national and international political and economic developments. That kind of news depresses me even more, often because reading it just fills me with a sense of helplessness in a willfully unjust world. If you'll excuse the oxymoron, it feels like kind of a secular theodicy.  But, since I spent an hour and half upgrading my weblog last night, or about 75 minutes more than what it would have taken a gifted Rhesus monkey, I figured I'd post about three random tidbits in the news.   Imagine if you could double bill at *this* rate   Plaintiffs' counsel Townsend & Townsend & Crew (San Francisco) is  urlLink seeking   $258m in legal fees from Microsoft for their work in a settlement of a California class action suit against the software company.

Other firms involved in the case are seeking fees up to $2,000 per hour for lawyers' time, and $1,000 per hour for support staff time.  Microsoft is arguing that these rates are excessive (the stingy bastards!). But plaintiffs' lawyers say that the rate is fair because of all the work that went into settling this case. Yes, I'm sure they worked very hard, and I'm sure every single one of those 6,100 hours was miserable and made every person who had to endure it wish for an early death (or more like for $3,000). And actually, I just browsed over to the firm's web page and clicked on some random lawyers' pages; and there apparently a ton of lawyers at this firm with doctorates - real ones, not J'D's. So I guess charging five-fold the customary rate per hour is justified because....    (a) these people have more student loans to pay back; 5 times more.  (b) (b)it's necessary to recoup the costs of putting all those extra letters behind people's names on business cards; and they cost 5 times as much.  (c) the cost of living in SF is *really* 5 times as high as everywhere else. Really.  (d) hookers and cocaine to celebrate the settlement; 5 times as many as usual  It'll be interesting to see what the judge rules on this. Actually, I take that back, it won't be in the least interesting. This is why I don't read the news. And this is why people hate lawyers.   The Sun is Going Out?   Strange but apparently true. A  urlLink story  in the Science Times about a trend in the last half century of decreasing sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. Scientists around the world have apparently noticed this phenomenon for some twenty years now, but it's been like the pink elephant in the room until now. Still, the magnitude and longevity of the trend is unclear, according to some people quoted in the article, and there is evidence that as air pollution has decreased in some parts of the world in the last decade, the amount of sun getting through has also increased. So it looks like we're not on our way to a slow nuclear winter, and that reversing our environmentally ruinous behavior does have appreciable impact on the economy.  Speaking of which, I decided to drive 2 blocks earlier today just to drop off some dry cleaning and buy a pack of index cards. But in my defense, the streets around here are practically uncrossable, since no one ever walks outside. The times were I do walk to the strip mall from the subdivision, I'm always the only pedestrian in sight.   Tom Delay   Is an asshole. This isn't really news per se, since it's pretty universally acknowledged. But I was reading something over the  urlLink AP  about a screening of new, even more graphic photos taken in Abu Ghraib prison. Delay was quoted saying that he thought that 'some people are overreacting' to the photos, and that 'the people who are against the war are using this to their political ends.' Interesting, that Mr. Delay would use this opportunity with the media to take a stab at his political opponents, castigation them for their callous use of such horrible material. I'd like to hear some Democrat or sane Republican come back and accuse Delay of being an opportunism, for exploiting the nature of these photos to get back at *his* opponents for *their* use, and so on, back and forth. Kind of like that episode of   Friends   where Joey and Chandler go back and forth pretending to be hurt by the other's joke about Joey missing his audition because of Chandler. It'd be great.  Anyhow, what's interesting to me is the way politicians say things like 'so and so is using issue x for political ends,' as if that ipso facto discredits that politician's position. In this particular instant, Delay seems to be saying that it's wrong to use an glaring example of the failure of the Administration's overall policy in this war to attack that policy. What is, after all, a political end? I can think of a couple possibilities here. 1. The end is to draw public attention to an issue important to the country. 2. It is to undermine the personalities within the Administration. 3. It is to garner support for some other issue that is important to the politician making the attacks. 4. It is for the personal aggrandizement of that politician.  Option 4 strikes me as unlikely in most cases (except Al Sharpton), and even if it were partially true for most people (I suspect it is) it strikes me as a acceptable price to pay if the platform of that politician is something worth supporting (like Al Sharpton). Option 1 seems like the ideal function of a political opposition in government. Option 2 would be a less than ideal function if those in power were otherwise decent leaders; but in the current situation, there needs to be personal accountability at at least the cabinet level for the magnitude of the mess in Iraq. Plus, when a scandal happens which, when examined in isolation and out of context seems not terribly serious (Watergate), can bring down truly awful executives, it is truly a virtue of the system. Option 3 is one that can and has been important to gather momentum for many important political changes, even though these changes may not be related to the scandal itself. For example, if by highlighting prison abuses, opposition politicians can mobilize public support for, say, closing the wealth gap, that would be totally great.  There is nothing wrong with using something that gets people's attention to draw that attention to important issues. This is how our minds work. When we see something that really sucks, there is a tendency, I think, to get into the mode of thinking 'this sucks, this ought to change or at least never happen again.' And once we start thinking that way about one thing, we start thinking that way about other, unrelated things, and we shed a general complacency that's been over this country for years, one that this Administration works very hard to keep over it. It is, however, wrong to take undeserved political credit for something, like Bush does in his 9/11 ads about ordinary people's heroic responses. That is 'using' an event for 'political ends' in the dirty, callous, and self-serving way.           \n",

      "              When Does It Stop?   I read this  urlLink essay  this morning in the Chronicle of Higher Education. It's written by an English (what else!) Professor about the endless competition of privileged students in high school, college, grad school, and finally in academe. The walk-away point is that academics all too often are where they are and do what they do because a deep-seated need for intellectual validation keeps driving them. Of course, many if not most professors simply love their work and the lifestyle that tenure provides. But I would not be surprised if the author's assertion is correct, that many people go on to grad schools, finish their dissertations, publish ceaselessly, and behave like pompous know-it-alls because those are ways to 'compensate[] for a perceived shortcoming.'  The author of the essay begins with a personal anecdote about competing to get into the best colleges while in high school. My high school class has its first reunion coming up in June, and this article made me think about the competition for college admissions that existed there.  I went to what by most accounts is a pretty good  urlLink high school . It was a laboratory school run by the City University of New York system, and accepted students at three different times, 30 for pre-Kindergarten, 30 more for First Grade, and about 200 in Seventh Grade. The graduating class size is usually somewhere around 200, since there are always some students who leave in ninth grade for another high school. I was one of the junior high kids, and I always believed that we were all part of the 'control' group for the experimental teaching methods they employed on the Elementary kids.   Unlike most schools of it caliber, mine did not charge tuition, and wasn't full of kids from the rarefied tiers of New York society. We were a mixed group; there were many children of professional parents, but probably more of teachers, government bureaucrats, and various other members of the petit bourgeoisie. I would also conservatively estimate that 15 to 20 percent of the students were first generation Americans or were themselves immigrants. The atmosphere was a competitive one, but not detrimentally so, not at least from my experience. Students unknowingly peer pressured one another to excel academically, but I've never know of any instances of sabotage or purposeful undermining of one student by another.   Still the atmosphere weighed heavily with academic over achievement, particularly when it came to the college admissions process. Every September the school newspaper publishes the colleges that the previous year's seniors attended, and the number that went to each. Although I don't have the numbers for my class, I remember that they were pretty consistent the with classes before me. Working from memory, I would estimate that a full third of my graduating class went to an Ivy League School, another 12-15 or so went to the other universities that made up the top ten of the U.S. News and World Report's from that year. Add to that another 10-12 that went to Swarthmore, Williams, and Amherst, the liberal-arts-college entente to the Harvard-Yale-Princeton axis. The other half of the class all went to a predictable list of colleges and universities in the top 50 of both categories listed in U.S. News, and less than a handful each year didn't go on to a four year program.   It wasn't until I reached college that these placement numbers became anything but ordinary. The cliche that many students enter Dartmouth as one of the smartest in their high school (possibly in many years) find themselves to be in the middle of the pack didn't at all apply to me. If anything, the cliche was inverted. Still, for three years of college I had little appreciation for the deep impact that high school left on my perception of relative academic accomplishment. To this day, I still tend to think of my going to Dartmouth as grudgingly accepting a silver metal (some days I think it's actually the bronze)  because I couldn't get the gold. But it was hard not to think this way when the chatter in the hallways was always about the HYP schools and how the other five were just the 'ghetto ivies,' (Brown is for intellectual light-weights, Dartmouth is for alcoholics, Cornell is mixed in with a bunch of state schools, Penn is so not-selective that it might as well be a state school, and Columbia is quasi-respectable only because it's in New York) or how one would have to be a total slacker to 'end up' in one of the State University of New York campuses.   It was more of a trophy-hunting attitude than anything else. One friend of mine went to Columbia, but that was ok because he turned down Caltech for quality-of-life reasons, so that partly mitigates his not getting into MIT. The only thing that prevented each of us from applying to thirty-something colleges (like they do at a lot of competitive high schools) was a cap imposed by the guidance counselors at 5 private schools per student.   I think this attitude stayed with me through my law school application process. I applied to 15 law schools in all. I told myself it was so I could hedge my bet, but in actuality it was totally senseless. Even the number of applications itself was decided on for worse than arbitrary reasons: I applied to one 'safety' outside of the top 15, and I didn't apply to #15 because it was in Texas, and because 16 isn't as nice a number as 15 (seriously!). In reality, it was very very unlikely that I would even consider going to more than half of the schools on the list. But I did it anyway in part out of fear, but also in part because I felt like each additional Top 15 school that accepted me somehow further proves my merit, just in case one or two acceptances were due to some kind of fluke or clerical error.   Sometimes I think that this kind of hollow competitiveness will end in law school. But now I worry that if anything it will get worse, because there are things like law review, and appellate clerkships, and then who knows, maybe the process will start all over again with graduate school applications and tenure-track job searches on law faculties. And then it never ends; it becomes publishing the most and in the best journals, attending conferences wearing the name of the most respected university in the field on one's name tag (and I hear from reliable sources that professors are particularly snobbish when it comes to those name tags). Once I've gotten used to defining success and failure based on these criteria, it is hard to switch to a different way of thinking about what accomplishments are meaningful in life - sure, *anyone* can have a loving family and be a pillar of the community, but you need a *degree* and $150,000 in student loans to do what I do... and so on and so forth.   And who knows what I'll do. But that's another question for another entry, probably prompted by another introspective rant from another professor on the Chronicle.          \n",

      "              Further Proof That Rupert Murdoch is Evil   I just read a very thoughtful  urlLink essay  from the Columbia Journalism Review by Brent Cunningham,   Across the Great Divide   . The authors writes about how print journalism has, over the past generation, increaingly lost touch with the working class and the poor in America. As the profession itself became more bourgeois, it has also gravitated to culturally and socially elitist views and interests, most notibly in the way it treats poverty as a one-dimensional problem, and how it all buy ignores truly working class Americans.  In telling this story, Cunningham helpfully makes a digression to define the terms 'working class,' contrasting it to what we normally think of as 'middle class' or 'capitalist class.' Class, according to economist Michael Zweig, ought properly be based on power and control over one's own economic well-being. However, we now tend to think of it as related exclusively to income, or to education, both of which though likely to impact one's class, hardly define it. Using Zweig's definition of class, we find that many more Americans are actually working class, some sixty-two percent of the workforce in fact.   And in fact most working adults do see themselves as working class, and respond as such when given the option in polls. But the national consciousness at the level of those who record (or arguably make) reality - namely, the press - still associates working class with the labor unions of the industrial age. The reality now is that the working class is composed of workers without unions and the benefits of union representation. They are instead powerless service workers with low skill jobs and even lower pay and non-existent benefit packages. It is this group that, according to Cunningham, most desperately needs and had traditionally receieved, the help of the press to publicize their concerns and tell their stories. Yet journalists today focus more on the extremes ends of the bell-curve of class in this country, the capitalist class and the poor (albeit in a problematic way).  Cunningham argues that changes in the profession of journalism, and in the journalists themselves, are largely responsible for this lacuna in the middle. Two related trends beginning in the 1960s are the corportization of the press and the professionalization of its journalists. Fewer and fewer journalists now come from working class backgrounds, and more and more voices in the press are under the control of 'corporate behemoths.' Cunningham notes that as recently as 1976, the   New York Post   made its 'last stab at bottom-up journalism' before being acquired by Rupert Murdoch. Journalists themselves started to become more homogenously members of the professional or capitalist classes, even while they became more 'superficially' diverse with the addition of women and racial minorities to the newsrooms.   The last third of the essay focuses on the problems in the way the press covers poverty and those living in it. But what interests me for the moment is why the press, particularly papers that have influence on the professional and capitalist classes, has shyed away from highlighting issues affecting so many working class Americans. What makes me think about this issue is the cover article in last month's  urlLink The Atlantic , an apologia by Howell Raines, the former Executive Editor at the New York   Times  , who was forced out after the Jayson Blair scandal.   One of his goals as the head of the   Times  , writes Raines, was to make the paper's weaker sections stronger so that the paper would appeal to more national readers who fit the demographic profiles of   Times   readers - i.e. the professionals and executives of America. The sections that Raines mentioned as the weakest were Business, Arts & Culture, and the Book Review, among other 'soft' sections. 'Soft' is, of course, thinly veiled code for sections, like Circuits, Travel, and the recently added Escapes, which appeal to people with plenty of discretionary income. Obviously, there is no reason to believe that strengthening these sections necessarily weakens sections that are relatively more in tune with the interests of the working class, such as the Metro Section. But what is important here is that the motivation behind Raines' moves is not the idea that it is essential for people to know about the best critic think about the latest opera at the Met, but that people   want   to know these things and they are looking elsewhere for that information when they should be looking at the   Times  . Readers are looking to the   Wall Street Journal   for news about the markets, to   New Yorker   for the arts, to the   New York Review of Books   for literature, to   USA Today   for Sports and rubbish about 'lifestyle.' In other words, what motivated Raines was not a committment to reporting what is important, but rather a concern for the bottom line of the New York Times Company. So much for 'All the News That's Fit to Print.'   The   Times   isn't really at fault, for it is just following the trend in order to survive as a business. Still, I am bothered by the pandering of the press to the interests of the wealthy. People rely on newspapers, particularly ones like the   Times  , to tell us what is actually important in our society and in the world, which all too often is not the same thing as what we want to know and want to read about. Raines writes in his article that he doesn't want people to pick up a newspaper with the attitude of 'I'm going to read this sonofabitch if it kills me!' but that attitude is far preferable to 'I'm going to read only things that I want to know and damn everything else!' I think I've written elsewhere on this blog about how media saturation and fragmentation has made it much easier for every one to filter out all information that does not relate to their own interest or confirm their own pre-existing beliefs. It would be sad if the press were no longer to act as the moral compass and motivator of the people with power in this country, but instead succomb to the their solipsistic self-indulgence.          \n",

      "              Slow Day   I just finished reading a few papers from a recent conference at Syracuse University on Citizenship, and will hopefully have something to write about soon(must get brain to work...). One thing right of the bat though, of the three papers I read, one was from a philospher, another from a political theorist, and a the third from a sociologist. While the first two are properly part of the humanities discipline, the last is at least in a name a social 'scientist.' So, one might expect that the prose of the scientist would be the most clear, jargon-free, and supported by empirical evidence. But what I found was the that philosopher and political theorist's essays were vastly more lucid than that of the sociologist, which was bogged down by jargon; poorly constructed, vague sentences; and hopelessly generalized and trite assertions. Here's a gem from the essay:        More broadly, the destabilizing of national state-centered hierarchies of       legitimate power and allegiances has enabled a multiplication of non-      formalized or only partly formalized political dynamics and actors. These      signal a deterritorializating of citizenship practices and identities, and of      discourses about loyalty and allegiance.  By the way, once I figured out what the hell these senteces mean, I also found that there was no evidence whatsoever to support these, as they turned out to be, rather outlandish statements.  Anyhow, here's a  urlLink story  that really tugs at the hear strings and shows how the little people always get screwed over by the (Swiss) Man. A federal jury recently ruled for Swiss Reinsurance, and against the developer of the World Trade Center, who sued to make the insurance company pay twice for the destruction of the towers because he claims they should be considered separate events. Swiss Re's victory is the latest in a series of law suits against a group of insurance companies that had insured the Trade Center, for a total worth of $3.5 billion. The developer (represented, incidently, by Wachtell) argued that the total should be doubled to $7 billion, but now it seems that he has to settle for the three and a half.   I suppose that one can look beyond the haggling over this monstrous event and think about the intellectual question of how we cognitively separate or conjoin events in our memories and in the stories we pass down through time. What defines the boundaries of one event: is it temporal or spatial? do we look at the consequences or the intent of the agents? But actually, I really just think this whole thing is kind of disgusting. Yes, I understand that life needs to go on and business needs to continue and that insurance exists so we can hedge against unimaginable events and that arriving at an efficient distribution of funds in the insurance settlement is best for the economy and so on and so forth. Still, the dirty part of this business is still bothersome for some reason that I can't fully articulate, especially because it seems that the lawyers involved in this case see it (as they do everything else) as a game between the two opposing counsels. These games involve huge sums of money, and the difference between winning and losing seems to be whether rich people become stinking rich or merely filthy rich - the presumption here is that to be stinking, one probably has to be   so   filthy as to start radiating an odor, but I welcome comments on my usage here.  Speaking of usage, I've never seen so many different ways of  urlLink calling someone stupid . The target, is of course, the president of these united states. But the novelty of this article is that, instead of being a 'well-meaning dolt,' Bush is actually someone who chose stupidity as a philosophy of life, thus making him far more dangerous (and also much less sympathetic) than the idealistic fool that even his supporters paint him to be.   And the voters still put him ahead in polls... Some day, someone is going to write a political treatise on the virue of the rule of the dumb; it'll be like a Plato's   Republic   for an idiocracy.          \n",

      "              How I Spent My Summer Vacation, Day 1: A Lesson in Statutory Interpretation  Note: I wrote all of the following down on paper last week, but haven't had a chance to post it. My life isn't that exciting, I'm just lazy.  I quit my job at the end of April so that I would have time to read, write, and study for the GRE's. With my job went my health insurance, and I'm not getting on the law school's health plan until August 1. For those in my position, the federal COBRA program is the simplest though most expensive way to continue on my old job's group plan. Essentially, I could opt to stay on that plan for a maximum duration of 18 months, but I would be paying the cost of the premium in its entirety, or some $468.59, or approximately Much More Than I Could Dream of Affording.  Fortunately, or so I'd thought, there is a state mandate in New York called Healthy NY, which provides subsidized health insurance through private HMOs to the working poor. At first I didn't think I'd qualify, since I'm no longer working, but one is also eligible for the program if one has lost one's health insurance for any of a list of acceptable reasons as long as one has worked within the last twelve months. The two reasons that concerned my case were (1) 'Loss of Employment,' and (2) 'Termination or Cancelation of COBRA' coverage. I thought that I would qualify for Healthy NY since I am no longer working, I have, in sense, 'lost' my employment. Just to make sure, I called Aetna before quitting and explained my situation to see if I'd qualify. A very nice but obviously clueless man over the phone said that I would be covered. It seemed that I'd won the day.  I called Aetna on Monday to sign up for the program, only to find out that it and every other HMO decided to narrowly interpret 'loss of employment' as exluding voluntarily leaving one's job, even though no such condition is specified on the New York State application form for Healthy NY.  This interpretation along with the text strikes me as horribly misleading. Plenty of people leave their jobs all the time for reasons much more compelling than my own, including those who do so in cases of 'constructive discharge.' It seems to me that if one is not working, for whatever reason, one should be able to buy into a group plan, especially since the program has a proviso stating that one must have had a job within the last twelve months, so people can't just stay on state-subsidized health care forever (because if we ever did that, then the terrorists would have won).   But I'd also read somewhere that the first test of statutory interpretation is to look at the 'plain meaning' of the text. Supposing that there is such a thing as plain meaning, I guess that I'm not exactly eligible under the loss of employment criteria, since I didn't so much lose my job as bring it back to the store with a gift receipt. It also makes sense that the text would not make me eligible, since the program seems intended for people who lost their own health insurance through acts not of their own volition, like getting fired or laid off.  The other eligibility criterion that applies to me (sort of) is the Termination/Cancelation of COBRA. Here is where it gets interesting. The only way that COBRA can terminate is if it were to run out after the elapse of the 18-month period. The only way to cancel it is if one does so oneself. This is an interesting point, because now it seems that onecan qualify for Healthy NY even if the qualifying event was something of one's own choosing, namely deciding to cancel one's own COBRA coverage. But if I can choose to end COBRA (for whatever reason, it's too expensive, I don't like my HMO, etc.) and go on Healthy NY, why can't I choose to leave my job and do the same?  I posed this question to the customer service people and a few supervisors at the various HMO's I'd spent all morning calling. Not surprisingly, I didn't get a good answer out of any of them. The best answer was from one supervisor at I think CIGNA, who said that Healthy NY covers people who can't afford their own COBRA coverage. 'Ah ha!' I said, so it shouldn't matter   how   it came to be that I am no longer employed, only that I can no longer afford to COBRA myself; and since I can't afford it, I should be eligible, right? Wrong. The criterion states 'termination or cancelation,' and since I was never on COBRA to begin with, I can't make myself qualify by canceling it. 'You can't cancel something you were never on in the first place,' the supervisor avered in a triumphant exercise of verbal reasoning.   That's   why she's the supervisor!  And, considering the plain meaning of the text, she's right too. If the qualifying event is the ending of COBRA per se, then I don't qualify, even if the reason I can't end COBRA is that I can't afford to get on it in the first instance. But that doesn't seem to matter before the sovereign power of Plain Meaning. Nor does it matter that the very existence of the cancelation criterion betrays the program's intent to cover those without the means to go on COBRA.  None of this seemed right to me, so I called the Healthy NY telephone line, which, not surprisingly, was unmanned. Next, I tried to call the New York State Insurance Department's complaints and consumer services division. The voice that picked up announced itself to be a test greeting message, and then hung up on me.  After five hours of trying to find a way to cover myself for the summer, I finally settled on an acceptable if more expensive solution: I would COBRA myself for the month of way, with the intent of canceling by June 1, so that I could apply during May to begin Healthy NY starting June 1. Only one more obstacle lied in the way. In order to get Healthy NY for a given month, one needs to apply before the 20th of the preceding month. The problem is that by the time my COBRA for May ends, it'll be too late to apply for Healthy NY for June. I was told by an HMO that my best bet is to explain in writing that my COBRA was ending at the end of May. Along with this letter I should include a letter from my employer stating that I'm no longer with the firm, a W-2 form to prove that I had been working there within the last twelve months, my driver's licence to prove residency in New York (my license expired on Friday, when they most likely received the application, so I think I have much more fun to come with this), 3 dead frogs, and a picture of the Crown Jewels of the House of Windsor (photocopies acceptable). All this, and I'm still not an inch closer to proving that I currently am not working at all. Amazingly, some guy from Empire Blue Cross actually asked me to demonstrate my unemployed status. How am I suppose to prove something negative? That's why   this   guy isn't a supervisor.  I think some people, Republicans come to mind, would use my tale as a caution against state subsidies for affordable private health insurance, pointing to the various bureaucratic hoops and the inevitable growth of government to facilitate this program. Actually, as I learned, there is no one working at Healthy NY, or none answering the phones anyway, so we won't have to worry about bigger government. The reason my experience has been a mess is precisely because we don't have universal health insurance, whether it is state of federally funded. If we'd had that, I wouldn't have to conduct graduate-level research just to find a new provider every time I switch jobs, or worry about taking a job because it has a such-and-such deductible in their plan with only so-and-so many doctors in their HMO network. Nor, for that matter, would I need to worry about textual analysis or speculate on the legislators' intent because I wouldn't need to fill out application forms for temporary coverage.  But no, that would be too complaiced and economically inefficient (and, lest we forget, the terrorists would win). Instead, relatively healthy people like me, who've taken out less from their insurance in their lifetimes than they'd put in in one month, should be spending hours just to figure out the paperwork. The people with actual health problems, they should spend hundreds of hours litigating their claims to get their HMOs along with Medicare, Medicaid, Medigap, Medi-dee and Medi-dumb to pay up. As for the people without health insurance altogether because they don't have the JD training to figure out the arcane system, they're probably better off pouring Robitussin over their injuries anyhow.           \n",

      "              Truly One of the Worst Ideas I've Ever Had  I decided a few months back that instead of going to Europe two days early and instead of being with Ariel for those extra two days, I would go back up to school for commencement. This decision is, without a doubt, the single stupidest act of social-time management I have ever made. I knew then, as I know now, that this will most likely be the last time I'll be back on campus for a long time to come; I also know that this is a rare chance to see a professor or two that I otherwise would not have. But it simply wasn't worth the effort, expense, and most importantly opportunity cost to do so. I guess it was false sentimentality that led me to plan it this way all the way back in December. But even as early as February, the last time I was here, I'd began to suspect that I wouldn't enjoy visiting as much as I'd thought I would.

      "              Biting the Hand That Feeds You  An  urlLink article  this morning about Venetians complaining that tourism is destroying their city. The comments from locals invariably compare the tourists, mostly Germans from my experience, to all forms of barbarians and invaders. But rarely do invaders account for 70% of a city's economy. There are definite downsides to such reliance on tourism, sure, such as the lack of small business services geared towards long-term residents (like a supermarket). Yet given Venice's crumbling infrastructure, it's unlikely that the city would be better off trying to attract another industry as a source of income - the entire place is built on rotting wooden beams. It's unfortunate that a whole city is becoming a museum amusement park, and now the mayor is trying to lure businesses back with the argument 'if you have to spend 10 hours a day in front of a computer screen, you might as well do it here.'    Incidently...  the ad on the top of the page with the Venice article was from  urlLink Emirates Airlines , the luxury airliner based on Dubai. I don't want to presume that they do most of their business with people in or connected with the oil industry, but it's anybody's guess why else a tiny Gulf country living purely off oil would need with a large luxury commercial fleet. Anyway, the thing that struck me both in the ad and on the company's homepage is that the picture of the flight attendants. They're all of gorgeous, radiantly pale blonde women. Just to be sure, I checked with the  urlLink World Factbook , and there is in fact no large Norwegian diaspora in the United Arab Emirates - although 8% of the population is made of Caucasians and East Asian expats, so maybe all of them work as flight attendants.   Generally, it seems that airlines tend to hire people from their home base countries. With the Emirates this is probably impossible, since first, there might be serious social prohibitions against their own women working, particularly jobs like this, and second, no one who is a citizen of that country needs work a day in his life in service jobs, since the state provides for everyone cradle-to-grave with government oil revenue. So, the airline needs to staff the cabins with women form somewhere, but not their own. The next best option, I guess, is to look who your passengers are likely to be, and then find attendants that look like   them  . This is probably how they arrived at the decision to staff up with Ingrid Bergmanns (or at least present the image of doing so).   Still, it's a bit weird, because the flight attendants all weird a head-dress that I can guess only is somehow related to the UAE, for they're certainly not Western. This suggests that the company isn't out to make their staff look entirely like their customers, and that is still wants to present some sort of Emirate characters for the airline itself. Why then, would you choose the puzzling combination of having a Barbie be the face of your airline, yet dress her up in some sort of traditional national costume? (It's Desert Barbie!) There is, I think, a much more cynical interpretation to this choice, but I'm not going to write about that.          \n",

      "              Bush Can Torture You   I just read  urlLink this story  on the   Times  , about a Justice Department memorandum from March, arguing that the Administration is not bound by either international treaties banning torture, or by domestic federal law prohibiting it. The memo, commissioned by Rumsfeld (there's a surprise), argued that torture is legal if it is approved by the President in his capacity as commander-in-chief (but not in his capacity as nitwit-in-chief), because he has the authority to wield any technique that would protect national security.   Curiously enough, the lawyers also argue that military personnel would be immune from international and domestic laws against torture if there were acting under superior orders,   'except where the conduct goes so far as to be patently unlawful.'   Hang on a minute. That statement seems a bit odd. How can any action appear patently unlawful (or 'manifestly illegal,' as I think the concept is usually called) to a soldier if all actions authorized by the President is ipso facto legal? The 'exception' in this case seems to refer to an empty set of circumstances, since no action will be patently illegal if the order originated from the President, or, more likely, from the Defense Secretary.  Another argument in the memo is that military personnel can torture people if they believe that such actions are necessary to avoid a greater harm. I don't have any idea what the necessity doctrine (if there is in fact such a thing) specifies, but the name itself suggests that it is a dubious justification for torture. The reasoning behind the necessity claim seems to be that, if one can avoid a greater harm   only   by torturing someone, then it is justified to do so. Torture is 'necessary' because it is the only (not simply easiest) way to avoid a greater harm. But it seems that there should also be the requirement that the torture must very likely enable the torturers to avoid that greater harm, and that this bar for likelihood be set very high. In other words, the information gathered from torture must be sufficient, when combined with other actions, to allow the state to prevent some harmful action. If there are other factors that make such an effective intervention unlikely, and there is always a myriad of other factors, then torture doesn't seem justifiable because it does not produce the only justifying result, namely the prevention of harm. For example, if by torturing some prisoner, the army can obtain detailed plans for some specific attack, including information that would enable it to stop the attack, then the necessity doctrine would be satisfied. Whether that is sufficient to justify torture is, mind you, a whole separate issue. But I don't believe that the necessity doctrine can even be properly invoked in the vast majority of realistic situations, if ever.  Not surprisingly, State Department lawyers dissented from the views of the DOJ. What is interesting is that lawyers representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff also disagreed with the arguments of the memorandum. Surely this is because the dissenting bodies have their own people at risk if other countries decide to follow the US's lead and start torturing captured Americans based on the authorizations of their respective village idiots. Neither DOJ nor DOD have its own people directly exposed to such dangers, so why should they care if other states start reciprocating? People like Wolfowitz and Feith and Perle and Carbone have the comfort and security of being far far away, both in terms of their persons and their bureaus, from the reality of war and torture. All of this is an academic exercise for them, a matter of assessing which 'technique' produces the most effective results.   I imagine that somewhere, right now, a bunch of lawyers are working to oppose to new interpretation of the Administration regarding torture, and are preparing to challenge that in court at the first opportune moment. Hopefully the courts will listen to reason, and this interpretation will be ruled illegal. Otherwise, the Administration might start torturing these lawyers, because, well, it is necessary that they stop their work preventing torture, so that the state can torture other people who might have information, so that it can maybe enhance national security.           \n",

      "              When the Tenure Track REALLY Gets Unbearable   TBS and the creator of 'The Bachelor' are producing a  urlLink reality version of Gilligan's Island . The premise seems to be that 7 people who are real life versions of the characters in the original show will be castaways on a desert island, and their task is to try to get off the that island. The show is now casting for a real skipper (preferably fat and quick tempered), a real first mate (preferably stringy and goofy), a real couple of elderly millionaires (preferably WASPy - though let's face it, they'll all be WASPy), a real movie start, a real Kansas Farm girl, and a real professor.  It was unclear what kind of professor the Professor was on the show. I suspect some kind of engineering or physical science. The only thing more ludicrous than building a radio and telephone out of coconuts is the idea that a literary theorist or ancient Chinese art historian is the on doing it. What is neat to me is that the show portrayed a professor as not merely a learned scholar, but also a virtuoso in functional know-how. How alien that image seems now (and probably did then, for all I know about the times). Professors these days are more commonly thought of as recluses who spend time and money studying specialties that are recondite at best, and criminally pointless at worst. I wonder what kind of a professor they'll ultimately cast for the role on this show.   For that matter, what kind of 'movie star' would do a show like this, on TBS no less? In order for the person to be credible as Ginger, she has to really be a movie star, but I never really knew what caliber a 'star' Ginger was. Presumably one does not need million-dollar contracts or Oscar nominations in order to be called a movie star, but would a dozen lines in some poorly reviewed, limited release B-movie be enough?  Also, the idea of the millionaire husband and wife team seems doomed to fail in the reality series (that is, fail more spectacularly than the rest of the show). The whole gimmick of the Howells in the original series was that here are these two stuffy snobs sent careening out of their element, and we're there to watch the hilarity ensue as they haplessly try to adapt to their new situation. After all, the show wouldn't have been nearly as funny if it'd been about a bunch of sailors marooned on an island. Millionaires per se are not hard to find in this country, and probably not that difficult to cast. But millionaires like the Howells would, I think, be impossible to find for the show, because nobody like that would ever do a show like this, and if they did, then their credibility as the stuffy rich guy is instantly destroyed. It's no fun to watch a millionaire struggle if he is pretty much like everyone else, only with more money.  Anyhow, that was way too much thought spent on this show.          \n",

      "              Some Updates   I spent the last week or so in Durham, North Carolina. On Thursday night I went to a Durham Bulls Triple-A baseball game. The ballpark was quite nice, and from the looks of it pretty new too. We sat right behind homeplate on the first base side, and had a good view of the field and the Durham skyline. The largest building in view beyond the park was the Durham county jail, a structure that was at least tweny stories high and occupied an entire city block. It was, incidently, right across the street from the ballpark. It showed up in all of my pictures from the game.   Now why would someone build a baseball park right across the street from a jail? Or, conversely, why would the city put a huge jail right across the street from what is probably the largest and most attractive civic builing in the entire city?  Also, planning for the summer trip is proceeding apace. I just spent a few moments on the phone with a woman at a hotel in Annecy, France, and realized at all the Hollywood renditions of french accents are completely accurate. Either that, or when French people learn English as a second language they learn with the inflection of Hollywood Franglais. You'd figure that people in the hotel industry, especially one that caters to foreign tourists (as oppose to, say, businesses with French contacts), and she did, though with curious vocabulary gaps, like the english word 'thirty.' (The french is 'trent'? what about french for 'first,' as in 'first of July'...?)  I'm always impressed by people who are verbally multilingual, even if it is for limited busines purposes. I had trouble with foreign language classes in school, particularly with the spoken aspects, because I am always so self conscious of my pronounciation. The dread of sounding foolish makes me not want to speak at all, even if i'm in a group of people whose spoken whathaveyou is equally hideous.          \n",

      "              Someone Who Understands Macroeconomics Please Help Me   The market price for a   hostel   room in the capital of Iceland (I can't spell it right now) is $50 per person per night. In other words, a single room for two people per night in one of these glorified homeless shelters costs about as much as a room at a reasonable hotel in almost any city in the United States. So everything is really expensive in Iceland. That makes sense. Consumable natural resources are pretty scarce, and external trade is very costly. This is all intuitive. What I don't understand is how the people there manage such a high standard of living. It seems that if an entire national economy is grounded on such harsh conditions, then things should be expensive but people should be poor. The alternative is that the people are very productive and make all sorts of stuff that they can export for other products and services that thery can't produce at home. The example I'm thinking of is Japan. Stuff there is exoribtantly expensive, and the people there have very high standards of living. But this makes sense to me because Japan is a insanely productive country. What on earth does Iceland produce them that allows them to afford a high standard of living while still making things so expensive???          \n",

      "           L.O.V.E.  what did u think it was? ;op  it's one of the most difficult word to apply, i realise.   things appear so wonderful when u are falling in love with a guy whom u think is the best on earth. the birds sing (not chirping irritably), the flowers bloom (not attracting bees and scaring people) and food taste better (even those canteens in industrial areas).  your heart skips many a beat when you see HIM. your breath quickens and you start talking in a giggly voice. you tell HIM little things (there's a cockroach in the office today!) and you do little things for HIM (sending him inspiring quotes everyday).  then as u embark on a journey of discovery... clouds of doubt start hovering over. why doesn't HE do this or that? why does He do this or that? why does HE behaves like this or that? am i bothering HIM with all the silly things i have done? am i irritating? if not, why doesn't HE reciprocate or show some indication at all? does HE really like me, let alone LOVE me? is this a mistake? Maybe, just maybe, the relationship was never meant to be in the beginning.  birds wake u up early in the morning chirping irritatingly (don't u wish to just shoot them off the tree). bees buzz dangerously close to u as they fly around the flowers in the garden (insecticide pls). and food is just tasteless, if lucky. else it's shit on ur plate (will someone do everybody a favour and fire the chef).  perhaps it is time to let go when ur consciousness are all about the pain and tears start flowing. it was good while it lasted. but another question pop up: who should decide the time to end it? how 'long' is it 'good' enough?  my 1st lesson in love taught me not to think so much, what counts is the happiness at that present moment. I applied it and found out that it is not totally true; the bitter aftereffect that follows the end of the relationship can be just as intense, if not more.  so my 2nd lesson learnt: consequences of being in or not in love cannot be belittled. one can have the pleasurable experience while in love at that moment, and will also have the painful ordeal of surviving the lost of love. cos eventually u are the one who is going to live with ur decision made that time and its repercussion.     after these lessons, i am starting to think, maybe it's better to continue liking a person than to start something with HIM if the relationship was never meant to work out. the best impression of the person remains in memory.   of course, u are happy when u are with HIM, in a love relationship. all the things done together become the beautiful memories which are so precious. but it is these treasures tucked away at the back of the head that will make it harder to let go. cos u have put so much into it, that u just can't say goodbye.  not now, not yet.  maybe things will change for the better. maybe we can work something out. but when it doesn't, it turns ugly. what u will remember of the relationship will be the nasty stuff, not the good ones.   wise old saying: it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved  my saying: it's an easier option to fall in love with someone you like than choosing to NOT fall in love with HIM. but the consequences are for u to bear, so u better think bloody 10x about that so u won't end up shooting birds early in the morning.          \n",

The universal answer was given: 'Don't know but try 1st lah'   hahhaha. i dunno to laugh or cry.   it's like i am so scared of leaving my family and friends, and slowly psychoing myself that it'll be ok. i will survive and it'll be a great experience in exchange for home-sickness blah blah. and now i may end up not going at all, let alone say leaving on time!  amazing how this big company works. simply astonishing.           \n",

      "           5 July 2004 Brazil RJ   Yo people!!!!  I just got internet access at my workplace!   it was a very tiring but fun weekend.  We reach Paris in the morning at abt 7am. checked into a day hotel (Euro 89 for that few hours!!!!) and went to Eiffel Tower. my 2 idiotic colleagues think they could just ask around in the sub way station while i thot they knew the way... so i went back and ask the receptionist. anyway french are snobbish assholes who think that French is the best language so if u speak english ' sorry i don't understand you' urgh! but we were lucky to bump into an old couple who were going in that direction and we figured out the way to get there altogether. after the effiel tower trip we went back to hotel in taxi (no train. won~t be able to make it for teh plane if we did!) i was napping and when i woke up, my legs were so jelly that i fell on the carpet and scratch myself!!!! my knee bled! hahahahhaaa.. was too tired on the 13 hour flight.   then another 12 uneventful hours and we reached Rio at 630, 2 of us stay at 2 different apt in Rio city while the other colleague went to our yard 3 hours away. went shopping with 3 uncles and at nite attended a party. the brazilian gals are BEAUTIFUL with GREAT bodies. now i am thinking, i won~t be able to achieve my goal: to find a boyfriend here... sob sob...  sunday went to another town, where our yard is based at. the aptments where one of the colleague is staying face the BLUE sea. oh my goodness. it~s really 'got money also can't buy'. really really beautiful but out of the way. it's almost a 3 hour drive to town  my apt is great too, facing the famous sugar loaf cliff and the jesus christ statue. really FACING. but next to us are slums... and last nite i heard gun shots for teh 1st time. the nite is lited up by the slums located in the hills... the city is so beautiful with the colourful stars. but it's ironic that the nite beauty of brazil is shone by the poorest.   today 1st day of work. already anticipating lots of things to come my way. will show u all the pics next time, i loaded into my laptop.

      "           Rio 12 Jul 04 Monday  Friday 9 July we had a farewell dinner for Larry at a Chinese restaurant. It was not too bad, and I had the good chance to talk to my colleagues. (and the owner’s cat is sooooooooo cute!)  The topic on Affairs of the heart came up. South Americans are known to be more passionate and possessive. Melissa, a local colleague said she thinks that passion can come and go, but not love. She believes that one can rekindle the passion that is gone. I argued: how would u know the passion will come back once it is gone. It’s the same issue as how would you know when to let go of a relationship when it’s stale? Guess… you just know it.  My input is that Asians tend to have passion only in courtship. Once family is set up, the passion is taken over by commitment to feed the family. Isn’t it true. Till now I have only seen a few cases where the passion is shown to each other, where love is for only each other and commitment is to stay with him/ her even with temptations around.   Gaffore said lust and love are inter-related. (somehow he always gives me the creeps. Especially now that he say this… yew!)  Melissa is with a guy for more than 3 years and they hardly see each other except during the weekend. So I asked what is passion? “it’s looking at that person and you go ‘WOW, she’s gorgeous’”.   I wonder, really, if anyone of my friends is that blissfully in love, in passion and in commitment. I will be truly happy (and envious, to be frank) for him/ her, and for myself too – because I will be convinced that such relationship exist not only in the Samba country. Maybe I will not be that lucky to have this kind of life… but hey, no one gets the best of everything! I am fortunate to know there is such thing. But till then I will keep hoping, and praying for my love ones to get such happiness.             \n",

      "             16 Jul 04 Friday  &nbsp;  Last nite we held a party for uncle larry, who is leaving for SG tonite.  &nbsp;  the place, which is a pub, is beautifully decorated with many antiques. 3 stories high and there is a live band playing local music (not samba, something milder). the things in the bar is for sale! but i guess it can get quite eery. i was frightened by this bronze statue HEAD of a man at the end of a corner.  &nbsp;  we headed to the place right after knocking off. the ppl here can just drink without eating dinner. there's finger food tho'. the beer here is quite nice, even i enjoyed it. have been forced by ppl here to take alcohol, like red wine and beer. hope my liver survives these 2 years.  &nbsp;  the music is addictive. there are dancers (or dancing students) who come here to dance to their music. the way they sway and move is so well coordinated. the old, young, sexy, pretty and ugly all got to the dance floor. there's this old couple... the woman looked so happy to be dancing! then i was (again) forced to dance. a male colleague invited me to it, and guided me along. simple lah, but also seem quite stupid '2 steps left 2 steps rite'. then there's another way to dance, which he said 'hope you dont mind but usually the ladies here dance more closely to the guy... and so i can lead you'. i said no, not knowing how close he meant. and yah, he is rite, I BLOODY HELL MIND! hahhaa. ok lah, it's just uncomfy to be so close to a guy. (and he is not good looking - this is THE point. haha)  &nbsp;  left the place abt 1030. really tired. but again i had fun. would love to go there again.  &nbsp;  this morning woke up to cook breakfast for uncle larry. hope he is not suffering from stomachache. he is so kind to deliver some letters and few boxes of chocolates for my family. i am so going to miss him. sob sob.  &nbsp;  the ppl here love to talk loudly. i am suffering from headaches for the past few days. and they slang very strongly. wah lau. the only time i have some peace is during lunch. urgh.  &nbsp;             \n",

(yes in sampan to go home. hahah)  yesterday made a HUGE mistake at work. i printed out a wrong set of documents and put it into a contract. thank goodness it was discovered before the vendor hope onto the plane back SG. else... i dunno what will happen. suffered many paper cuts, and i think i killed many more trees than i think i should. hikes! then boss ask me: so have you tried to negotiate with them (there's some issue i am supposed to trash out with the supplier)and get them to agree to our terms. i really tried. i think my weakness is i have a soft ear... instead of them agreeing to us, i helped them to look for the stuff! haiyo, must be hard. boss say 'this is how it is like. Who has the buying power? If (whoever has it) say jump off a bridge, the other must oblige. if he say kneel you must kneel. IF U WANT THE CONTRACT. else u can just walk off.   that's how business goes is it?  For the less than 14 days i am here, i have been having dinners and lunches with suppliers. They pay the bill of cos. it's so different working here. in SG, i can't even be allowed to be seen with supplier outside. here.. well, guess it's much lax here. much much more. really unused to the fact i am eating for free most of the time.   one of the SG uncles going home soon. then my boss going back to collect his work permit (meaning no need to renew his visa every one month kind. its a semi perm, for 6 months to 2 years). then i will be alone here. the uncle is so nice, he cook breakfast for me everyday, and yup, i have definitely put on weight. theres a gym at my block. will visit it when free. but these days been so tired and always reached home at nite. dunno where to find the time to lost weight. i think i will join the advance club. not bui bui but FAT FAT.   i am using ICQgo! at work, meaning i can chat online as long as i have internet but i dun have the contacts. i need to add again. if u girls have, then add me: 82702332 (Suzzie). i will turn it on everyday at work from 8am to 6pm. hope to see u all soon.           \n",

The bathroom drain is clogged. hope to get someone in to fix it soon.   10 Jul Sat evening we had a dinner together at Sam's plc, a gal here till Sept from Fels. The guys here smoke like chimney. Lost abt SG$15 from gambling. never have luck in these kind of money. I cooked this thing taught by Larry, the E&A guy who is gg back SG soon- Dumpling with Banana (and some jello like sweets). NOT BAD!!! my virgin dish received good comments! hahahha. i made some ham sandwich too,  just in case the dumplings sucked.   Got to know this Brazilian Born Taiwanese at the gathering.. she is working in Fels Setal (Keppel Fels in Brazil). Pretty lady, and she was commenting how brave I am to come to brazil to work.   To me, its really an opportunity idiotic to miss. Maybe even if sent to middle east I will seriously consider. The world is getting so much smaller. I will only be a frog in bottom of the well if I stay in SG. No offence to those who beg to differ. I mean its individual preferences, especially if one already has a direction and a goal in mind. No point diverting and get lost. Maybe I am just adventurous.   Sun was a rainy day here, 17Deg. Who on earth say Brazil is a sunny place!!! hehe, no lah, its just the winter.  Found a shopping plaza near my place. Goodness, it is huge. the clothes are much cheaper than in SG. haha. now i noe where to go on weekends.  Will be learning to drive once i have some basic portuguese. here no car is so inconvenient! but boss say he is scared i go out alone.. that i may get into trouble. think he meant with the police or so.. heard horror story that they demanded US4000 from our guy when he and his family didnt bring passport with him. but later bargain to R100 (abt SG60 or so).   thats the update for now... have asked Fels to give me internet connection. dont care. i am getting so BORED in my apt.             \n",

But hey, life’s unfair isn’t it?  1st day in brazil, where I will be spending most of my 2 years here.   The nite scene is so beautiful. The hills occupied by shanty towns (squatters) are lighted up like colorful stars. It’s really sad that the beauty of this country is shone by the poorest citizens. What an irony.  The moon was a glowing orange red color as it rose up the sky tonite. I thot it was the sun!   The people are reputated to be very friendly.

Larry cooked for us a sumptuous meal of salmon, pork braised in country wine, soup and lembak chicken (something like lontong). We left our place at 715pm to catch a 1020 plane. Thot we have more than ample time to get there, but we missed a turn and got into this bus terminal town. It was a busy town, streets filled with peddlers trying to sell things like fruits. Many kids running around selling things to the cars stuck in jam. We lost our way and couldn’t get out. Larry hopped into a cab with his luggage, then me and boss followed him. Then we get stuck in a jam for about half hour with my boss and Larry getting anxious. We saw children climbing up a lorry and stealing drink. Then a kid run up to our car and cleaned the window. Poor things. Finally we got out of the jam after much swearing and cursing and reached the airport. But Larry wasn’t around! The taxi driver left him lower level – arrival hall. By the time he queued up, he was the last 2nd one. And he has to pay overweight charges of US$1000 (over by 23 kg). And when he wanted to take one luggage out – “no, it has been sent in, and we don’t have time to do that”. Poor thing.&nbsp; just got to learn that he need not pay afterall. think he will be refunded. &nbsp;  Today is a rainy day. My plan to visit the nearby shopping center, with many stalls in the alley like basar malam was drenched by the rain. The wind was huge today. Can’t wait for summer to come, really don’t like the cold, and can’t do so many things. I haven’t seen so many places with the weekends all wet and cold! I am hoping tomorrow will be a better day. I am not asking for bright sunny day but please stop raining! But finally I get to enjoy my apartment. I am very at home at my place now. But the real test hasn’t come yet – cooking. Think I brought all the Chinese ingredients for nothing. Would rather go out and buy something than cook! Hated the oiliness and the cleaning.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Melissa is a very sweet girl. She offered to bring me around, and gave me her number so if I want to go around I can call her anytime. Such a sweet girl.  &nbsp;  Tonite a colleague is cooking dinner. Ah – boss just called.

Saw them on Sat afternoon and Sun morning. Were they there all the time? They were hunging small boxes of chewing gums and sweets, probably trying to sell.   I have also seen kids knocking at the car windows at red-light junctions, asking for money.   Don't the government have welfares for them?  It is saddening to see, they have to endure the&nbsp;hardships of life at such an early age. What will become of them in the future? Probably end up as local valet parking service-provider, getting R$1 or R$2 for each parked car. Or peddlers selling snacks along the Niteroi bridge to the cars stuck in jams, in freezing cold rainy days.  life is unfair.           \n",

      "             24 - 25 Jul 2004  Left for Sao Paulo on 24 Sat morning.   Selso is&nbsp;a brazilian Tommy sent to pick me up at 515 am. Well, i overslept and thank goodness he call woke me up. rush down in 10 mins and as usual, duck and chicken talking.   he went to pick up another guy, a caucasian at a hotel in Rio then we went to meet the rest of the guys; Tommy, Samantha and Lionel. Me and Lionel took Selso's car and luckily, they can communicate through hand language. I was totally lost.   It took us about 6 hours to reach Sao Paulo, stopping for snacks along the way. Brazil is scenic, with so many mountains and hills. We passed by this lake or river, and cos it was still early, there was a layer of fog just above the water. Can't decide it's mystically beautiful or just plain eerie.   Selso had to stop to ask for directions to our hotel, Blue Tree Tower. Many times. he would wind down his window at EVERY opportunity and asked the driver or passer by how to go there. I think he asked more than 10 times before we found the place. Heard that is the case in brazil, one shouldn't trust only a person's direction advice cos they would point different places, cos they want to help.   But brazilians are really helpful. On our way to the shopping centre, Selso did the same thing, and there was this uncle who stopped his car and came to tell us how to get there. and as we con't the same direction for a while, he would yell to us how to get there at EVERY opportunity also. But we still got lost. Especially we have to coordinate with the other car Anthony is driving it was tough. we circled around a stadium (today there was a match, Brazil with Mexico or Argentina, not sure. but just heard alot of shouting and fireworks, think Brazil must have won) with policemen on horses. Wow, damn cool.   There, we finally had our lunch at 2 plus. Chinese food (Tommy Sam and Anthony wanted that. Me and Lionel were like, we have been eating many types of food, BUT brazilian food). And went shopping for 2 hours. bought a pair of shoes at R$50, a bit too tight cos no size. a thick jacket (really warm) R$60, a pair of jeans abit too loose on the backside, or i have a thick waist... have to alter back in SG, at R$40, and 2 Zara tops at R$18. Great buys, i think, for 2 hours for less than SG$100.   Sam was sick, so we went back to the hotel and rest. Later that nite the rest of us went to the nitespot in SP. We went to this pub but the nite ended early cos Tommy suffered from both gastric attack and Lao Sai, and Anthony was tired. I gulped my Malibu and ended up sleeping in the car. Cos the guys wanted to see the Red Light district, helpful Selso (who had taken 12 Caparinas, a very strong local drink and 2 Beers in the Pub) asked EVERYONE how to get there. The waiters, the bouncers, the passerbys.. so in the end everyone knows where we are going. In the end, we decided to go back hotel since the whole of SP knew where we planned to go.   The next day was short. We went to a flea market downstairs. The stalls sold old old stuff, and makes me wonder who would want to buy them. Collectors maybe. Saw a couple of nice earrings but the thot that it might be worn b4 gives me the creeps. As we walked on there was this parade on the whole stretch of road. Stalls selling handicrafts, art work, earrings, blah blah were set up on the road side. A fortune teller yakking in portuguese with his bird tried to give me&nbsp;a telling, but due to communication failure, i decided not.   There was dance showcase on stage. Dancing hot samba like dances, and one performance replayed Dirty Dancing. Was fantastic. Further there was a lady teaching how to dance something like line dance. it seemed easy, was so tempted to join in!   The stalls offer so many things and so cheap. i bought 4 pairs of earrings, and 2 handicraft - handpainted tiles, at R$3/ pair and R$5/ pc. so cheap. too bad we couldn't really explored thoroughly, cos we need to check out at 12pm. Finally reached my nest at 7pm and was greeted with a spoiled tv and a flooded bathroom.   Actually SP is a big city. I think these kind of flea market is common in Brazil, and ironically i have yet to go to any in Rio. Comparing, I think i like Rio more, cos they have more to offer like beaches and many more beautiful things, the Christ Redeemer and Sugar Loaf.   It was a good weekend after suffering in silence in Office. =) hope i am recharged before facing another week.             \n",

      "             1 Aug 04 Sun  Went to the Hippie Market at Ipanema. So nice! bought quite a bit of things.. Many handicrafts are sold. one stall sells face masks made of leather (interesting). Art pieces are also sold. We ate African traditional food, which i didn't like. This young girl came to ask for food we didn't finish. really poor thing. Then saw golden retreivers puppies being sold. The parents are also there, i guess to show the potential buyers the good breed. As we walked along, huskies, chihuahuas, terriers, cocker spaniel are sold too. SO CUTE. urgh. altho i dun agree with selling them, but at least they are in hands of animal lovers. was thinking abt the pet breeding farms in Singapore. haiz, think the animals here have a better life.  31 Jul 04 Sat  Spend the 1st half of the afternoon at a chinese restuarant with the SG ppl. It was the looongest lunch i have ever taken. we arrived at 1pm, and the food came at 2.30pm. we left the restuarant at 3.30pm. it was so long, that big boss had to tell the owner to hurry up serve the food, cos he has to leave for the airport at 4pm!  Then Lionel, Sabah, Melissa, her son Joshua and me went to Sugarloaf. It was beautiful. There is a pub also (brazilians love to party, and will create any opportunity to do so). Then there are groups of ppl exercising. not the SG kind of old ppl doing taichi, but doing aerobics, yoga (somehow seem like Falun Gong to me) and cycling (on stationery bikes... funny huh.)  From Sugarloaf can see the Christ statue on the next cliff. we also caught the sunset. beautiful.  At nite, Lionel and I went to the nite spots in Lapan. We went to the biggest disco. We did a test to see how many guys want to pick me up. so i went walking around alone. nope. but was molested by this idiot, who used his elbow to brush me! so angry, i pushed his arm away. hope his hand rots!  Then caught a few boys starting a fight in the middle of the dance floor. the security stepped in to stop it. one of the boys was stopped by a girl, and the whole event has a 'happy ending' with the winner smooching the prize away all nite. sounds like cavemen to us. hahaha. There was a band who came to the stage to sing, with dancers in the back. of cos skimpily dressed. The girls are not that hot, but one of the male dancer was W.O.W. great toned muscular body with a killer smile. The dancing was the main attraction, and whenever the gal expose her little panties under the short skirt, wolf whistles and cat calls are heard.  A fat man approached me for a dance. yah rite, over my dead body (which will be when he tripped over me during the dance). then as we leave, another young boy wants to talk to me.  WHY I ATTRACT PERVERTS, FAT GUYS AND YOUNG BOYS!!??           \n",

But I was abit upset when he said that he wants to make me the first woman project manager in Keppel Fels.  Wah lau, if i dun live up to the expectation then isn't it very 'throw face'. of cos happy that he has such high hopes on me, but must he tell everyone or not... Nevermind. say whatever he wants.  After dinner we went to a disco pub. It was nice, but the crowd is abit old (hang out with old men, what to expect. haha) Then Melissa told me that a fat man next to us while ordering drinks at the bar told her that he loves me! so funny, and he was yakking 'Chinatown Chinatown' to her. hahah... Then the night proceed on quite ok, danced with the SG ppl, and at the dance floor a young boy wanted to get to know me. Why do i keep attracting the WRONG ppl?  Went to Leblon and stayed for the weekend at Sam's apt. There was porn channel.

Well, first of all, we can say goodbye to cheap computers... since most computer components are made in Taiwan.... next we can say goodbye to cheap everything else... since everything else is made in China... and our countries would probably refuse to trade with China. So what do we need? Really, Taiwan to back down somewhat. I don't want to see them loose their independence... but it might be better in the long run. Down with communism. Down with China.

      "            Max Ehrmann Desiderata  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.  Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.  With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.       -------      I love the last line. Strive to be happy.

      "    The other day I was rummaging through the garbage of a particularly fine looking establishment, when all of a sudden I came across a newspaper article documenting the recent campaign for the Presidency of the United States of America. After wiping a particularly runny egg from the front page, and promptly licking it off my hand, I took notice of the contents and a chortle escaped from my lips (as did some runny egg). There on the front page, the current President, Georgie Porgie Bush, was plastered (referring to the image and not his blood/alcohol level for once) in black and white; wearing a smug expression on his mug as if to suggest that he could cure all ails with his beady eyes and signature condescending smirk. I personally don't buy it. In fact, he tried to help us once, and he fucked up good and right. It was and continues to be the mess known as Iraq.   My thoughts on Bush are that he is merely a pretty boy lacking one important quality required to be a pretty boy, and that, my friends, is the privilege of being pretty. Prettiness is a gift from the gods that I just so happened to receive upon conception, so I speak from experience. Yet, I must be honest - the blessing of eternal prettiness can occasionally turn around and bite the beholder in the balls. I once met a doctor in the Lesser Antilles who referred to this as gonorrhea, but I'll thank you very much not to ask why I was inquiring about it in the first place.  So, back to the matter at hand, let me pose to you a question. Without a pretty face to fall back on, what does that leave our President Bush with? Intelligence? Obviously not. Charisma? Hell no. I'll tell you what it leaves him with. Absolutely jack squat! So what good is a President who has zero skills and nothing but piss poor qualities? None whatsoever. He's gotta go!  Never an offender of the equal time rule, the newspaper made sure that directly next to Georgie's photo was a picture of the slightly more grotesque Senator John F. Kerry. Along my travels I have read many cleverly executed articles making light of Kerry's striking resemblance to the fictional Mary Shelley character, the Frankenstein monster. While I normally extract no pleasure from the mockery of another's appearance, I must admit that Kerry's picture chilled this weary ole seafarer to the very core, and I'd say that the only thing he's lacking are two well-placed bolts and platform shoes. I'm sure he could borrow the stammer from Bush.  But while Kerry is not a pretty man, he does possess certain qualities that I find admirable in a leader, even though he has yet to attain that title. The most important of these qualities is that he has taken a human life. Hell, I'm sure ole Johnny's robbed several Vietcong souls during his tours of Vietnam, and I'd wager my left eyeball that he's offed more than a few transients upon his return to the states. If you gave me a ten minute search of his house I'd present you with a necklace made of ears!  But before you denounce me as a heartless lunatic with no credibility to judge character, please allow me to explain why I find murder a good quality in a leader. For one, it shows that he is a man who takes initiative. Instead of sitting on his ass, listening to Jimi Hendrix, smoking reefer, and waiting to catch a bullet with his forehead - or getting his daddy to keep him safe for that matter - Kerry wandered the countryside adding notches to the butt of his gun like any proud American would. It proves that he can make decisions and stand by them. If that does not a leader make, then I shall fashion a shiv and jab myself in the gullet right this very second!  I cannot begin to elaborate on Kerry's other promising qualities, because personally I feel that his passion for slaughter is reason enough to appoint him as the head of our great country. Though, despite the fact that I have been applauding his achievements these past few paragraphs, I want to add that Kerry is simply the lesser of two evils. In a perfect world, neither of these two dolts would have been permitted to run for the presidency in the first place. However, being that this is not a perfect world, as evidenced by the fact that I was severely abused as a child and presently have no place to call home, I submit that Kerry would do less harm than Bush already has.  As I stood in front of the trash can daydreaming about the state of our country, a thought crept into my mind like a mouse looking for cheese in a bear trap. What we need is a president who will run this country the way it deserves to be run; not some cartoonish puppet! We need a man like Quint McGuinley! I've been a traveler most of my life. I can wander the countryside and campaign for the good of this greatest of islands! If I can impress upon a few people in each town the importance of writing my name on the ballot, and they can convince others to do the same, then all hope is not yet lost!   I clutched that newspaper to my chest and crumpled it in my hand so that what was left of the chicken embryo dripped down my forearm and stuck to my arm hair (promising a good nighttime snack). Then I looked to the heavens and thanked the gods for providing me with yet another glorious epiphany. I thought I heard a response, but soon realized it was merely a noise coming from behind the house. As I tilted my noggin for a better listen, it seemed as though the noise was getting louder. Wouldn't it figure that what I heard was the guttural howl of six Rottweilers who were not yet privy to the fact that I was going to be the next president of the United States? I made an attempt to run from the yard, but the unmerciful beasts were on me in seconds! I fought tooth and nail with the little scrappers, but as I had not yet consumed any Pabst Blue Ribbon that day, my legs were still a tad shaky. Sure enough, the buggers had me on the ground quicker than you could say 'Antarctica' and it took all my might to keep them from tapping into my jugular like a bunch of fratboys on a keg of Keystone Light.  The wretched little bastards gnawed at my extremities for a good couple of hours until I finally managed to crawl outside the perimeter of the electric fence and their collars rendered them incapable of any further attacks on my person. Despite massive blood loss and severely tattered clothes that left nothing to the imagination, I believe I fought the good fight that day. And as I crawled back to the abandoned railway car that I had fashioned into a temporary home, I was filled with a new sense of purpose. A euphoria coursed through my veins that I had not felt in years, and while it could just as easily have been the onset of tetanus, I took it as a sign to begin planning my next move to become the next president of the United States of America...      \n",

      "   A comrade of mine once equipped me with the knowledge that nurse sharks are apparently one of the most docile species of shark in the great blue sea. Well, the pure thought of an easygoing shark was absurd to me, and being a man of first hand facts, I made it a point to seek out said nurse shark and find out the truth for myself.  So, I chartered a boat and set out on the waves of the seductive Atlantic to seek my answers, ultimately sailing for fourteen days before I finally found what I was looking for. Turns out I spent most of that time wandering the deck deeply entrenched in the chartreuse haze of an absinthe binge.  Well, upon regaining my faculties I noticed that my sandpaper-skinned treasure was hovering in wait directly below my ship, which I had only just realized bore the name “Sara’s Nipple” on the bow.  What an odd name for a ship, I thought to myself, chuckling like Santa Claus.  Only my belly was very much unlike a bowl of jelly.  If I had to liken it to anything, I’d say it’s more like anything that holds various internal organs, some Jim Beam, and occasionally about a pint of lacquer thinner, and happens to be encased in multiple layers of fatty cells.  But that’s beside the point.  So there they were.  Swimming around like giant toothy worms were four deadeyes, as I like to refer to them, grinning up at me.  I couldn’t be sure, but I thought I heard one of them say,  “Oh look, it’s Quint.  Hi Quint, you sonuvabitch!”  After wrestling me back, me mates tried to tell me that p’raps I was daydreaming again, or that maybe I had a bit too much sun, but I was under the impression that these damn fish were taunting me and I wouldn’t stand for it!  So I donned my two-sizes too small (for intimidation purposes) wetsuit, fastened my goggles to my ocular cavities and steadied my mind to concentrate on the task ahead.  My first mate, Richard Dreyfuss, recommended that I also wear a scuba tank, but I promised him that it should take no longer than a single breath would allow for me to prove the superiority of man to these unwitting sharks.  So, with nothing more than a flashy wetsuit, goggles, an erection, and not to mention my rapist intensity, I cannonballed into the chill waters of the mother Atlantic that day and cordially invited all three of the “easygoing” phallic symbols to engage in a bout of fisticuffs.  Being that they were slightly better swimmers than I, it took quite some time before I managed to close the gap between us, but once I did, let me assure you, there were no more thoughts of taunting ole Quint McGuinley running through their tiny little shark brains.  I could read their minds via the vacant expressions on their streamlined little faces and I’ll tell you what they were thinking.  All three of them were thinking: “Holy areolas, what the hell did we go and get ourselves into?  This specimen before us is indeed superior in every possible way.  At first it was difficult to detect the awesome mass of greatness that is this man, yet alas, here it is, for all to see.”  The oversized fish silently pleaded with me to take pity on them.  Their beady shark eyes stared at me like black holes and I could almost swear on my seven dead wives’ graves that I saw a tear.  But they refused to attack.  They were smart, I’ll give them that; the stubborn bastards almost had me believing the hoopla about them being docile animals.  But I was wise to their game.  I knew that no sooner than my retreating foot would touch the wooden deck of “Sara’s Nipple” that those beasts would unleash their stifled chortles for all to be heard.  “Quint McGuinley,” they’d say, “why if ole Quint McGuinley is as big a pussy on land as he is at sea, then we wouldn’t be surprised if he were runnin’ home to drink a bottle of vinegar and water to ‘freshen up’.”  So rather than face such horror, I remained exactly where I was, albeit not taking into account the sporadic bobbing up and down caused by waves.  I stroked my beard for a second, smirked, cocked an eyebrow, eyeballed my cock, and eventually puffed out my glorious barrel of a chest and swam the butterfly stroke toward my adversaries.  As it turns out, I was correct. The animals were vicious and unrelenting beasts. However, it did take some coaxing on my part, and by coaxing I mean that I had to grip the sharks by the gills and bludgeon them about the head and face area with my muscular forearm for several minutes before they finally retaliated. But ultimately I proved my point. And that's how, sans my left leg, I hopped back onto the boat that sunny day and smiled to Richard Dreyfuss.  'Peanut brittle ass,' I said to him, 'the transaction that has transpired today will forever change the course of world history.  This fete will be lauded as the most invaluable of all human accomplishments and you can be certain that the good Lord is looking down upon me with disdain that could only be considered a thorn on the stem of jealousy.' Apparently, I passed out shortly after making that proclamation though you wouldn't have known it by the fact that I continued to wear my trademark grin and my one-legged form remained standing upright on deck. Sure, I lost a leg that day.  Some say I lost a little respect, too.  But not a single second goes by where I think to myself, “If I could do all that over again, and skip out on the part where I jump into the ocean and pick a fight with three sharks to avoid future problems like phantom limb pain and massive diarrhea…would I?  Would I indeed!”  Not that I think about that kinda stuff, because I don’t!  But if I did, my answer would be “NO, I wouldn’t skip out on that part!”  Quint McGuinley is a man among men!  It has oft been rumored that one time, on an expedition through the Rocky Mountains, he savagely beat a grizzly bear to death for sassing him about eating the entire food supply in one sitting.  Some folk say that the rations consisted of a single can of beans, and still others like to pass word that it was six full-grown elephants that he consumed that day.  Of course it is also rumored that I, Quint Quintly McGuinley, spun that little tale while engaging in a Moonshine chugging competition somewhere along the coast of the Amazon River.  Whichever it was, you can rest assured that ole Quint is as grizzled as they come and there’s no way in hell he’ll ever quit referring to himself in the third person, no matter how hackneyed it becomes.  And another thing, when I commit myself to a cause, you can be damned sure that I won’t give up until the day that I am struck dead.  In fact, you probably can’t even be certain then.  The Lord knows I’ve pillaged entire villages during REM sleep, so why the hell should death halt my endeavors?  Well, lately I’ve been hearing tell of more peaceful (and I suspect Cannabis imbibing) sharks and I’m plum sick of it!  They’re all vicious carnivores as far as I’m concerned and I’m fully committed to proving it.  In fact, I'm planning a trip in a few months to the Pacific to display to the world that Whale Sharks aren't the pushovers that people say they are.  I’m so convinced of their innate savageness that I’ll make the claim right now that I will sever my right leg with a toothpick if the Whale Sharks don’t do it themselves; I promise you that!  Some people have said to me, “Quint, are you nuts?  Making a claim like that just means you’re going to lose a leg either way.  What do you stand do gain by such an idiotic stunt?”  And I look them dead in the eye, wonder for a minute whether they are siding with the sharks, and then I stammer: “A leg is a paltry price to pay for an accurate catalog of the temperament of oceanic species.”  At which point they’ll reply: “But Quint, wake up!  You’re offering up a second leg!  Two legs are surely way too much to lose for such an absurd experiment you drunken asshole!”  To which I’ll retort: “What’s that, landlubber?  Speak into me good ear!”  And when they fall prey to my ruse and lean over to assist what is actually a perfectly healthy ear, I chomp off each of their own ears and spit them on the table.  And then I lean over and say: “Now would you say those ears were worth your opinion, landlubber?  'Hardeeharhar!'  And thus concludes another entry in the journal of Quint Quintly McGuinley!   \n",

      "   You know Singapore Football has hit rock bottom when the only Chinese dude in the team gets the boot from the National Team.   'Tan quits national team after being axed' -  Streats, 22 July 2004  Yes sir, that's Mr Tan Kim Leng for you. You know the guy with the chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in his condo somewhere? Yup, it's him all you envious, red-eyed cretins out there.  How could the FAS&nbsp;do that? Don't they know that the guy represents 75% of the population of Singapore? Very soon, they are gonna axed the Malays who represents 20% and then the Indian (5%).   That will leave us with 0% of our races (if you don't include the 0 point something Eurasian community here) in our National Team. So what are we gonna do?  Simple, just import them from all over the world. We already have guys from Africa, Brazil and Eastern Europe donning the ol' red and white of the Lions, having been granted citizenship for their short stint here.  And&nbsp;they didn't even have to serve NS&nbsp;for that!&nbsp;Just do what they do badly - Kick a ball. When they reach retirement, they can pack their bags, slap their bums and&nbsp;say 'Thanks for the money', then&nbsp;laugh all the way back to their native countries.  Thanks for kicking the ball in our turf and taking our money away&nbsp;dudes!  If the current trend of axing our national players continues, the team that represents Singapore at World Cup 3XXX will have none of our native born heroes. It has already happened at Sea Games 2003!   The entire team was made up of dumb blonds&nbsp;with fancy boots who can't score to save their lives. They play as prettily as their pretty hair but they forgot that the goal of the game was to put the ball in the opponent's net. Duh!&nbsp;  Back to the topic of Mr. Tan Kim Leng, the guy with the chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in his condo somewhere.  His sacking came after the recent debacle where the Lions fell again to our neighbours. You know we shouldn't call it a debacle anymore. Let's just call it a tradition. Everytime you hear our boys go play Malaysia, just say, 'Oh, we are gonna lose again.' :-c  When told of FAS' decision to axe him from the squad, the very defiant Tan retorted, 'No problem. I won't go back to the national team. I'm someone who plays with passion, but what do I get in return?'  If red is the colour of passion then&nbsp;Mr. Tan&nbsp;is truly a passionate man (he's got a&nbsp;chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in his condo somewhere, you know). Every match he plays, he sees red. The guy was rewarded for his passion by seeing red yet again in last year's Asia Cup qualifier where we got thumped 4-0 by Kuwait.  Following last year's humiliating 4-0 thumping by Malaysia (you know those guys who always&nbsp;claim it's our fault when things go wrong?) at home, the boys set out across the&nbsp;Causeway to regain some of our pride.  All the signs were looking good for a win for us. We had a full squad while the Tigers had 5 of their regulars missing from their squad comprising mostly of their U-23 squad. Yup, the same fellas who spanked&nbsp;us at the National Stadium last year.   Well, we did regain some measure of pride. We lost 2-0 only this time. Well done, boys! Next time it will&nbsp;be 0-0!&nbsp;  I believed that the match was held at the Bukit Jalil Stadium, a 40-50,000 capacity stadium but only 1,000 spectators turned up to watch the game.  If they tell me that these&nbsp;guys paid for the tickets, I will shoot them. Paying spectators? Bah!  We all know that when any delegation from&nbsp;Singapore goes over to Malaysia, a whole plethora of officials or what have you accompanies along. You know, like excess baggage.  I bet my butt that the 1,000 are made up purely of officials from both sides. We will probably make up 80% of the crowd because we have more money of course. Duh.....  So who are these guys there then?  The Goal 3xxx commitee no&nbsp;doubt.   FAS bigwigs and their family members.&nbsp;They were given complimentary tickets to the game.  Former Goal 2010 officials like Jan Poulsen and his cabal. FAS had thought that our boys would wipe the smirk off their faces and justify their decision to axe them. Of course after the game, these guys still have their smirks and their wallets just as full.  The commitee who sacked the Goal 2010 commitee. They are the ones who suggested that tickets to be given to Jan Poulsen and the rest. They also wanted to see the smirks wiped off his face. So who's laughing now?  The commitee who is going to sack the commitee who sacked the Goal 2010 commitee. The game hasn't been concluded at that point but Singapore very kiasu one you know. They are there just in case.  The various who is going to sack who commitee. The one for Tan Kim Leng no&nbsp;doubt was there and taking tons of notes.&nbsp;  The rest are made up of runners who are supposed to get kacang putih and kua chi for their bosses.  When you add those numbers up, it is quite surprising that their numbers only make 800 of our good folks. Maybe the commitee who is going to sack the 800 did not make the trip. Otherwise they would have doubled the numbers.  My heart would have gone out to you Mr Tan. It's hard to play when you know you have so many eyes scrutinising your passionate display.  But hey, at the end of the day, you still&nbsp;got your&nbsp;chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in&nbsp;your condo somewhere. Now that's something I will never sympathised with!  Cheers dude!   \n",

It's amazing that the same problem applied to both sexes can wield so&nbsp;varied a result. Here's some of them....  Suggestions from Martians - Lace bait food with some chemicals like bleach or something... might help to kill them... and since the rat actually goes back and i think they regurgitate for the 'kids'. so if its poisoned... you kill the kids too... i hope (those from ntu and/or cornerstone probably can guess who this brilliant person is)- 'Pengkang' some cuttlefish to tempt the rat - Use industrial bait glue.... equally powerful &nbsp;- shud use the cage one, its more expensive but u get the satisfaction of drowning them when u catch them. how u do it? dump the whole cage in a pail of water, best way is to put the cage in the pail and slowly fill u the cage with water. u will see how the rats run about nervously and their last moments when gasping for whatever little air they have left. hurhurhur  Suggestions from Venus - Use sweet food. Feed it lots of sugar and let it die of diabetes. - btw, read in enid blyton (story: the doll that lost its squeak, in case you wanna verify the info given) that rats love wax...so if you've a couple of candles or tealights, that may do the trick.  - Cheese  Morale of Story:  Beware of those from Venus. Even when they are plotting to kill you, they are capable of masking it with tender loving care. Guys you have been warned. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!   &nbsp; My suggestion? Buy a cat!   \n",

Interesting read:  &nbsp; In the past week, I've learnt:-  &nbsp;  -&nbsp;the different ways to say I love you in Myanmar....&nbsp;Girls give guys handkerchief, guys give girls Ks1,500 (the local currency) either figuratively or literally. So what does this show? That in Myanmar, the guys still get the raw end of the deal :-(  - that in Myanmar, I still can find my coca cola, MacDonald's and KFC, except that it is called Star Cola, Mac Burger and KLCC - I kid you not. Same recipes, same formula:-)  -&nbsp;if I see a doctor in Myanmar, and call myself like U Jaw Danai, it will cost me 50 times less than if I report myelf as Mr Goh Danny :-)  - the mean of 'chit say yar lay'. It means cute in Burmese. It is also the most common phrase that people use on me :-) HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!  - The&nbsp;modernization of the Singapore medical services can be summed up by taking a look at&nbsp;the knees of my Singaporean colleague in Myanmar.&nbsp;He has had three operations on both his knees. First one left him with a 30 cm scar (normal surgery), second one with a 15&nbsp;cm&nbsp;scar&nbsp;and the last one with a 5 cm scar&nbsp;(microscopic keyhole treatment). Ah, the wonders of science.  -&nbsp;The office phone bill for last month came up to about USD 1,000.....&nbsp;Those that have been sending me large files (those above 0.25mb), I am begging&nbsp;you once&nbsp;to stop sending.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - 'Computers for Dummies'&nbsp;Lesson 1: To check file size, right click on file, select properties, see&nbsp;general tab under size. 1,000kb&nbsp;= 1 mb.&nbsp;  - &nbsp;'Computers for Dummies' Lesson 2: Alternatively, to check file size, mouse-over designated file and wait, properties of file will be displayed in a&nbsp;pop-up window.  - 'Computers for Dummies'&nbsp;Lesson 3: Mouse-over means moving your mouse to the selected file in question.  - If Lessons 1 to 3 are making sense to you for the first time, good luck to you:-) It may high time that you seriously consider a switch in careers, preferably to one that does not involve the use of computers:-)  - Speaking of mouse, my housemate and I brought in two rat traps to deal with the rat issue at place last week. Not those&nbsp;humane cage kind, those you see in the cartoons with the recoil that&nbsp;snaps&nbsp;the back of the rat. OK, OK, so its pretty cruel - but bo pian, this is&nbsp;the&nbsp;only bloody rat contraption that they sell here.... the cage one is too expensive.- It has been about a week, so far the score is rat 3 danny 0. Lemme see, so far, he has robbed me of one bar of&nbsp;kit kat, a whole chocolate biscuit and some Japanese crackers.&nbsp;  - The recoil on those rat traps are damn bloody powerful. I should know. While setting it up, I accidentally triggered the trap. It nearly left me with a broken finger. Luckily all I had from the experience was a very bruised finger and an equally bruised ego :-)  - I am open to suggestions as to what food do rats like to eat, coz I&nbsp;am seriously running out of ideas:-)  - I am boring more and more people to death with my emails. Getting less and less replies with each email that I send.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  That's all folks (to the tune of looney tunes&nbsp;closing credits&nbsp;song)  Danny   \n",

      "   8 A.M....   It was&nbsp;the morning rush hour.   I was&nbsp;taking an already packed MRT Train with a hundred others&nbsp;at the same station.   Great!   Seems like at whatever the time, the train would always be packed..  Ok, so I got crammed into the train with the rest of the crowd as usual&nbsp;and as always, I picked a spot to make my stand.  Back off, folks. This is my spot, no one&nbsp;is gonna share it with me.  But too bad, my fellow commuters&nbsp;would never&nbsp;know the meaning of personal space.  Even if there were&nbsp;only mere inches between me and the other person&nbsp;or to&nbsp;whatever I was standing next to, they would still go right in&nbsp;and claim that spot.  Never mind that they&nbsp;would barged into me or would be standing with&nbsp;our bodies touching and their body heat&nbsp;(and sometimes odour) emanating forth to add to my sense of&nbsp;claustrophobia and to the general discomfort I&nbsp;was feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Never mind too that their files, books, bags, brollies and their whole assortment of paraphernalia were making their presence felt on me by poking, rubbing and&nbsp;tickling me at the most uncomfortable places.  You know what?&nbsp;These folks just have no sympathy for their fellow commuters. They are merciless and heartless.   But you konw what too? It's time to fight back!  I thought of an invention that I hoped to get patented within the next few years.  Yup, you guessed it, it's the personal space maker.  Basically, it's a wristwatch you wear on your hand&nbsp;that by pressing a button, an invisible force field will encompass you entirely for up to a radius of 1.5 metres (it might vary with different folks but 1.5m would be the minimum for me).  Anyone who comes near me&nbsp;-  Wham!  Ouch, that must hurt but sorry, you are encroaching into my personal space. Please step back.  Cool, huh? This would definitely be the invention of the century.  Later, man!    \n",

      "   Lunch went well I guess....  &nbsp;  The Mee Kia was satisfying enough.  &nbsp;   Like Adrian said, 'It's just nice. Not too spicy and not too bland. And it's all meat!'     &nbsp;   Pearls of wisdom.     &nbsp;   So back to the office we go, to face the doldrum&nbsp;of work. I forgot my Wadi Time again and I had the cheek to SMS Melvin to do his :p     &nbsp;   Well, at least&nbsp;Adrian&nbsp;was having a field day again. Those blasted truckers were calling in, threatening to rape his father, mother, brother and&nbsp;sister.     &nbsp;   Hokkien expletives in all its glory!     &nbsp;   I had to admired the guy's gutso by retaliating in earnest. It's an art form for him in the highest.   &nbsp;  '#$%#$! You want you go ^%#%#$%. Don't call unless you return the containers cleaned. $#%#$$%!' Good job, dude! That's telling them!  &nbsp;  I had to call the company from Greece to get the money again. I really hate that. Somehow, the distance between our countries was clearly reflected in our telephone conversation which was more akin to a shouting match.  &nbsp;  'HELLO! I AM CALLING FROM HEUNG-A, H-E-U-N-G HYPHEN A! I AM TERENCE! I NEED TO SPEAK TO....'  &nbsp;  'Hello, I can't hear you! You need to speak louder. You are calling from?'  &nbsp;  'HELLO! I AM CALLING FROM HEUNG-A, H-E-U-N-G HYPHEN A! I AM TERENCE! I NEED TO SPEAK TO....'  &nbsp;  This would really test my nerves when it was repeated the 3rd or 4th time. After which, I still had to get round what a hyphen was.  &nbsp;  'It's the 'minus' sign. You know, the 'dash'?'  &nbsp;  'I'm so sorry but I don't understand,'  &nbsp;  It's worse when you hear your colleagues sniggering in the background. You just pray that the other party would&nbsp;somehow decipher whatever gibberish she was hearing from me.  &nbsp;  Viola, she did. Thank God! Thank goodness!  &nbsp;  'It's ok, we will remit the amount in your company's bank by today,'  &nbsp;  'Thank you,'  Whew, praise the Lord!   &nbsp;  If scum could go any lower then it certainly did when I eavesdropped on Alex and Jaffar. Actually, I didn't have to be so sneaky about it. They spoke so loud I guessed even the whole office could hear it.  &nbsp;  'Alex, you gotta give us new notes otherwise the captain will not accept it.'  &nbsp;  'New notes cost more. If he doesn'accept, then how? I keep is it?'  &nbsp;  'Yah lah, I put in my pocket also man.'  &nbsp;  Bouts of hearty laughter.  &nbsp;  Yup, I am sure the both of you would pocket the dough and I bet it ain't your first time either.  &nbsp;  The more&nbsp;I look at them the more I just want to leave the company.  &nbsp;  Ok job, good pay but sucky culture.  &nbsp;  Met Jon online, spoke a bit.  &nbsp;  Continuing with my assignment. Looks like I won't meet the dateline. Uh-oh, here we go again!  &nbsp;  Michelle posted a comment. You are welcome, dear. Make sure you bring more guests.  &nbsp;  All right,&nbsp;it's Smallville Time.  &nbsp;  Also time for&nbsp;Wadi(Prayer) Time later.  Signing Off...&nbsp;     \n",

      "    Monday Blues have leaked into Tuesday.   &nbsp;  I am barely getting by today. Stuck at work with nothing to do. That's why I am inputting this entry :p  &nbsp;  Lunch as usual involved a little brainstorming between Adrian and me.  &nbsp;  'What/where do u wanna eat later, dude?'  &nbsp;  'Anything/anywhere,'  &nbsp;  Same question, same answer.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The monotony!  &nbsp;  We decided to head back to the place we lunched at yesterday. It was the 1st time we went there together.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We thought the Mee Pok/Mee Kia was absolutely tasty so to avoid having to be asked the same question everday, I told the man we should just go there everyday until we got sick of the food.  &nbsp;  'Right on!'        \n",

      "   So it begins…   So what has happened in the world as I know it before I started this thingy?   1. urlLink Rocket Ronnie thumps the field to clinch the World Snooker Championship for the 2nd time.    Here’s wishing you more success in the future!   2.  urlLink Inter  has appointed a new manager in  urlLink Roberto Mancini .   Of course, this piece of news will only interest Inter fans like me. And I guess this will only matter to me since I am probably the only Inter fan around.   So far, I have only known losers who support teams like Liverpool or Man Utd.   3. Greece won  urlLink Euro 2004 ! No doubt the members from the squad have already been added to the Greek pantheon.   Our dear Lions can take a leaf off them by winning World Cup 3xxx.   Wait! The idea has been scrapped. The goal now is to win Tiger Cup 3001.   What a way to usher in the new millennium!   4. Alex Pagulayan has won the  urlLink 2004 World Pool Championship ! The dude declared it 'The Game I've Been Waiting To Win My Whole Life'.   Together with the mantle of World Pool Champion, he gets to pocket a cool USD 75,000. Of which, 30,000 will go to clear his debts and the rest to feed his frenzy of partying and boozing that will sure to follow after his amazing come from behind victory.   Well done, dude! What a way to spend the greatest moment in your life, to wake up the next day with a nasty hangover and with zero in your bank account.   Cheers to that dude!   5. Our Lions have lost to Malaysia again following last year’s 4-0 demolition job by the Tigers in the Lions’ Den.   The good news is that we lost only 2-0 this time.   Next time, it will just be 1-0 followed by 0-0 the following year. Who knows, we might beat them someday.   Yeah, right…   Coach Raddy blamed the defeat on the referee. When we got spanked 7-0 by Oman last month in the World Cup Qualifier, the ball was at fault (poor thing).   So who is he gonna blame next? My mother?   6. I think the best thing I did today was to SMS Rachel to thank her for bringing me into the Music Ministry. Never thought of that until now.   Thanks, sister! Now I can do what I enjoy most, karaoke worship style!   7. Adrian just informed me that Smallville starts at 10 PM instead of 10.30. No wonder I thought the show was getting shorter nowadays. Duh….   8. Another season of Alias has begun and I am a few episodes behind already. Wait up Jennifer, I am coming!   9. Coffee never smelled so good until you decided to quit it.   Yup, my life as I know it is going the way as it should.   Here’s wishing for more good times ahead.   Cheers!        \n",

      "   Keith Andrew Morton Born     : 5th June 1979 Departed : 15th August 2004     This was someone I know from my secondary school days although though he was not from my school or that i know him that well.  The epitaph above were his actual words in 'Friendster'.  His story appears on the Straits Times 16th August 2004,  P3 .  urlLink [Click Here]   I met the guy only a few times before his passing but I always thought he lived his life as he said he said he would.  A few years ago, my football team beat his team 5 - 1 when he was not around. They beat us 2 -1 the next time round when he played. Since then my team mates have always been talking about him.   He was one heck of a player.  I learnt from people close to him (and this was also reported in the news) that he had just returned from cooking school in England and was starting his own restaurant soon.  I heard he was one heck of a cook.   Pity I will never find out how good.  I thought he was one heck of a person.  Those who know him mourn for him deeply. So do I, even though I do not know him well.  His passing has left a void in many people's life for he was the light in many people's life.    His passing is like a candle snuffed out too soon to leave the world a little less brighter.  Rest in peace, Keith.  May angels watch over your sleep.  \n",

      "   The sun crept up the Andonean Range, scaling to the summit in labourious fashion. Light trickled lazily into the bamboo forest below, nibbling away at the fringes of the departing dusk. As the sun reached its zenith at the top of the highest peak, the creatures of the day awoke to the rebirth of the sun and then the place suddenly exploded into life.  Light poured into the forest like a ferocious wave, revealing the forest in its most resplendent glory. It shimmered like a green emerald at the foot of the mountain, pristine and bright. If the Andonean was a king, the bamboo forest was like the finest cape he wore. And if the sun was God, He was surely bestowing all His glory upon the forest with His light.  Any traveler standing on the top of the Andonean would surely have been awed by the spectacular view below him. He would surely have been captivated by the sheer beauty of the forest in the morning light. His imagination would surely have been stirred by the sights and sounds he would have beheld if he had set foot within its confines.  Its sweet lullaby and wondrous beauty was like a siren call to any traveler but there were those who would hardly be tempted by it.   He had stood since dusk in the middle of the bamboo forest, watching the ascent of the sun up the mountains. He had looked on unflinching and unimpressed as the burst of fire suddenly swept into the forest. The light of sun lit his eyes, fueling the purple flames that were his orbs. He stood as if staring directly at the sun as it straddled the top of the mountains, staring defiantly in the face of the fire god. For how many could look upon the fire god and not be harmed by it?  No one that was except Kenzen.  Having defeated the fire god, he turned his back to it, like a victor turning his back to a shamed and vanquished foe. His expression was impassive as ever in spite of his victory. He had never allowed anyone to look beyond that boyish face.   Ever.  His purpose in the bamboo forest was not done yet though. A more fearsome foe awaited, the only man in the whole world who could strike fear in Kenzen’s heart.   Kenzen’s super keen sense of hearing was strained to the limit as he tried to pick out the direction of his foe’s methodical and confident footfalls. It was a near impossible task and he could swear that the man floated instead of walked. He relished a challenge more than anyone and he had never been bested in combat all this while. His erstwhile opponents had been swept aside with consummate ease and he had not had a serious fight for the longest time.  Such are the hazards of a reputation that preceded him.  Then, out of the blue, as fate would decreed, the gods finally had enough of his supremacy and would conspire to fashion a opponent so awesome that he would strike fear even in the most invincible of beings.  Musa, the True Prince of Camorazzan.  His appearance startled Kenzen. For the first time in his life, he had failed to notice the arrival of his foe. The fact angered more than humiliated him. Still he felt in spite of that he would put things right again, the fear in him be damned. Musa, like all others before him, would be vanquished.  The prince smiled when he saw Kenzen. The latter could not help but cringed at the warmth of the prince’s smile. All his foes came armed with a scowl and with nothing but vengeance on their minds or filled with unadulterated hatred for him. No one but the prince came with the most disarming personality. The sincerity of his smile was like a dagger to Kenzen’s side. Kenzen had never been greeted like that before.  The prince was an anti-thesis of Kenzen. He was all magnetic charm to the latter’s aloofness. He was a picture of confidence and grandeur to Kenzen's well-hidden chasm of self doubts and fears and the latter's friendly disposition was a stark contrast to Kenzen’s morbid pensiveness.  Their differences were even more obvious in their physical appearance. The prince was tall, fair and strong while Kenzen was slight, dark and frail looking. The former looked magnificent in his all-white garb that complemented the splendour of the forest. Kenzen’s all-black attire on the other hand was an eye sore, an abomination amidst the beauty before and around him.   While there was an aura of positive energy emanating from the prince, the very air surrounding Kenzen seemed to wilt before him.  While the prince beamed, the latter scowled.  “I thank you for accepting my invitation to meet me here,” the prince spoke with sincerity, seemingly oblivious to the hostility oozing from the smaller man.  Kenzen almost gulped but checked himself in time. He would not show any weaknesses to his opponent. He had come here expecting a duel of sorts. This was the norm of his life - to fight one battle and one duel after another. He lived to fight and to relish the utter defeat of his foes at his very hands.   All the opponents he had encountered were battle ready and itching to fight him but not the prince though and that very notion scared him more than anything else.  Here in front of him for the second time in his life was a man who had no desire to kill or humiliate him. The first was Charity, but she was a thousand leagues away from here. Kenzen just did not know what to make of the seemingly gentle and unassuming man before him. The prince’s friendliness did more than just put him ill at ease; it made him even more wary of him. He would never have survived this long in the world if he had let his guard down every so often.  Though he had never seen the prince in combat, he already felt part of the battle lost - the contests of wills. This was something he felt that the prince was peerless in. If so, then he would be a formidable opponent indeed. Kenzen had to steel his resolve before all was lost.  “Enough of your niceties,” he retorted, his voice weak compared to the prince’s. “State your business you have with me here and be done with it!”  The prince was momentarily taken aback by Kenzen’s tone as though hurt by the latter’s clear rejection the offer of his confidence. Kenzen smirked, regaining some of his lost confidence at the prince’s wavering demeanour. But to his horror, the prince recovered in no time at all.  “I did come to parley with you, my friend,” said the prince, now sporting a stern countenance. “I merely wanted to establish an understanding with you.”  “I am not your friend and I never make friends with anyone, not even with a prince.”  The prince sighed. It was not a sign of exasperation though. Rather, he was disappointed at Kenzen’s sarcasm. The vibe the latter got from the prince was akin to that of a parent’s disapproval of an errant and willful child’s behaviour. The thought of that maddened him further. The blood rushed to his head.  Draw your damn weapon, prince, and fight me like a man!   “I knew it would be difficult with you but nevertheless I will say what I will have to say then leave, if that is what you desire.”  “Great, I thought you will never start.”  Come on, something’s going make you fight me! Come on, draw your weapon and fight me, dammit! Come on!     The prince continued, unperturbed by the latter’s callousness. “You have a gift, it’s obvious, with the sword. And in your case, that’s two! What you did back there was something never been seen or done before. You fight with more skill than all the weaponmasters of Camorazzan combined. But you fight like an animal, with no quarter or mercy given to anyone. You slaughtered many men out there yesterday. What you did to them was close to despicable.”  “Your point being?”  “You lack direction, a cause,” Kenzen laughed aloud at that but allowed the prince to continued in spite of that. More than he knew it, he was intrigued at what the prince was driving at. “You need a cause to temper your killing rage. You behave as if you have no respect for life whatsoever, your own included.”   “Are you God to tell me how to live my life?”  The price sighed that sigh again. The heat in Kenzen rose up another notch and he had stealthily unbuckled his swords.  One more of that and I will surely kill you!   “That would be too presumptuous of me wouldn’t it? No, what I am to offer to you is something you might worth considering. I offer you a cause worth fighting and living for. Join me, Kenzen. Fight for me!”  “Now that is going way beyond presumptuous, isn’t it? Join your cause? Join you, the enemy of my people and go against my people, my country and my king?”  “I never knew you were such a loyal subject.”   Feleperon  and  Isenejaer  flew out of their scabbards in an instant. Kenzen’s face contorted in rage but somehow he just stood where he was. He was barely in control of himself anymore and he would pounce at any moment.  The prince appeared unfazed by the monstrosity that he had somehow conjured up before him as he went on, “There is that monstrous anger I was talking about! I came here not to pick a fight but to offer an alliance with you. But I guess my friendship is something you have no desire of. But if it’s a fight you want then you shall have it!”  With that, the prince whipped out his awesome saber  Sauraefie .     Finally!  A wicked smile found its way to Kenzen’s face. Though it was a grotesque sight, it had not the desired effect on the prince.   The prince stood face to face with the monster before him, unafraid and as stout-hearted as ever. It seemed like he had a point to prove to Kenzen and he was determined to see through its course.  “Come and face the might of  Sauraefie !”   That was all the invitation Kenzen needed.   To be con’t.        \n",

      "   8.15 A.M Tuesday Morning....  Waiting for the morning rush hour train as usual.  Almost couldn't get my butt off the bed just now.   Monday Blues had taken a huge toll on me, I almost couldn't survive the onerous boredom and tediousness of work yesterday.     Well, no choice gotta make a living and people are leaching off me as always.     Sigh!   Standing by the platform, I suddenly had a flash of inspiration again.  Instead of standing around in the train and getting shoved around, I should make space for my self to be comfortable.  Yes, my own space!  Of course, I have already thought of the very wonderful  Personal Space Maker , so what I thought of was not a new invention but something that is much more feasible.  Yes folks, a foldable chair. Not the big ones but a mini one that looks like one of those movie directors use.  Heh heh!   Of course, it is not wise to put the chair anywhere on the train, especially in the middle. Those punks will just rush in and topple me over.   Bad Idea, the middle.  So, before the train arrives, I will just shove my way to the front of the crowd who would already be standing inside the yellow box.  You know, I could have sworn the box meant for something for these guys? Like you are supposed to stand behind the yellow lines?   Well, nobody seems to care about that, what more me, the eternal law abiding fool? I've had enough!  I figure that I will probably get a lot of irritated stares by doing that but no one will actually dare voice it out.  Hey, they let the guy in Bishan walk around the station aimlessly, sit on the edge of the platform and then junped into the path of the oncoming MRT.   No one bothered to even report the matter to the station's staff before all that even if they could tell he was a suicide case.  So, in typical Singaporean fashion, we will do what we always do when faced with an out of ordinary situation - use Eye Power.  That's an army term for just staring and not lifting a finger to help when needed or asked to.  Anyway, back to my ingenious plan... The best spot will be at the doors opposite of the the front doors. There, you can get to lean your back against the plastic panel by the side.   It's a good spot also because everyone else will be squeezing to the middle of the train. Can't imagine why when the back is relatively empty before we reach Jurong East Interchange.  Well, everyone's stupidity is my gain. Suckers.  I will probably attract a lot of attention but that's not neccessarily a bad thing.  My fellow commuters may think  that I a looney and keep their distance, thus according me with more space than I would need.  AH AH AH - I am starting to think I am a genius and the rest morons.  AHHHH! I can just imagine the comfort now.  No more getting shoved around, getting told off for trying to protect my hard-earned personal space and getting POKED in the most uncomfortable places by thoughtless and insensitive commuters.   The whole experience will be made perfect with a cup of coffee and this morning's papers.  Hey, I am sure there are no MRT laws against this right? I think I should patent this litle innovative thought also.   Can't afford to have too many competitors, you know.  Ok, dudes, later!    \n",

      "       'So how did that deal with the dead bum work out?' Andrew asked, referring to a story I recently wrapped up on police brutality, culminating in a week spent masquerading as a homeless person.  'Homeless person,' I corrected. Bums are people, too: most of 'em. 'Yeah. The dead guy.' In the last three days of my assignment I had stumbled upon a homeless man who had evidently decided to exit by the fire escape; he was still cooling when I found him and made the call to 911, only to be flatly refused help by the cops. Turned out the city didn't want to be tying up precious taxpayer money and time with some nobody druggie, or so I was told. Two days after my story went to press three cops resigned in controversy over a post mortem that revealed one hundred thirty-two bruises on the lower torso 'by blunt, heavy object'-- read baton-- and no prior history of drug use. Even a newbie cokehead would've known better than to snort an eightball in fifteen to twenty-five minutes, let alone the managing editor of the Homeless Times; a homeless man by choice for ten years whom it turns out was onto the same trail of copshop slight-of-deed that I had been sniffing out. Rodney King eat your heart out.  'Pick up the paper every now and then, maybe you'll learn something.' I don't slave away at my job to go unnoticed, even by someone who considers fortune cookies heavy reading. 'I just wanted the inside scoop; you know, the shit you left out of the paper.' 'Oh.' So he had read it. Maybe I should feel bad.  'I let them have both barrels; what you see is what you get.' The truck made an abrupt about-face into the convenience store parking lot just in time to save me from having to flog a dead bum. I'd been answering questions for a week and a half; the giddy feeling had worn off precisly thirty seconds into the first barrage of inquires. I always heard what fame does to a person; my name next to a frontpage spread barely constituted notoriety and already I was tired of the heckling I got everywhere I went. Always ask the questions, I repeated to myself.  'Two cases, and a tall boy or two if they have them.' Andrew reminded me as I slid out into the rain. I found the cases alright, but no tall boys. I smiled to myself for the first time in two weeks. There were two homeless people in line behind me at the register, gearing up for another night of boozy desolation. When I first joined their ranks, it broke my heart to see homeless men throw away what little they had on alchohol every night; by the time I left the streets I could hold my own with the best of 'em. The party's the same regardless of what circle you rub shoulders in, I thought as I listened to the two bums argue over pocket change. Only matters where you wake up in the morning.          'Hey, you're that anti cop guy at the newspaper, aren't you?', the store clerk asked as I ponied up for one case of light beer and a sixpack of good stuff. 'I seen your picture on the news.'  'Yeah, I'm the guy that wrote that article.' I contemplated grabbing the beer and making a break for it before the inquistion started when the cashier asked the two bums behind me,  'How's it like getting attention from the papers?'  That's it, I thought. I grabbed my beer and started for the door, thinking to nip this interview in the bud, but only got one leg shaking before the world began to resemble a merry-go-round on a Scott Weiland acid trip and I was forced to make an emergency exit by the fire escape.                       \n",

      "       I hate the rain.      Nothing serious, its just that with three straight days of the stuff I start to sympathize with Noah and that ark situation-- the inlaws, the smell. And I don't even own a cat.      While the rain drummed incessantly on the window overlooking 31st Street, I looked over my shoulder and took a medicinal shot of Jameson. Life is hard enough without sobriety.  Never look back, Samantha used to say; tonight though, forward visibility is zero and the radar's in the corner, quietly becoming inebriated.  Samantha had obviously never read Peter Egan-- hell, I didn't remember her reading anything but astrology, a tactic I thought odd for a law school hopeful. Forward visibility was never that great, I mused, or else perhaps I would have seen the animal's gaping maw before it ripped out my heart.        'Hair of the dog that bit me,' I said as I poured a shot into the old flagon, but got no response. Probably a good thing, considering I was the only person in the room. Sanity? Check. Another shot of Jameson? Check and check. The old flagon refills quickly on a rainy night, I noted with dry wit; the corollary being that the old bottle empties disproportionately faster. Maybe the Jameson bottle is still running on Dublin time and thus empties itself four hours early; maybe the distillers forgot to set this particular bottle for Texas time and it was still humming Greensleeves, unaware that we eat our meals on Central Standard around here. Maybe the bottle wasn't water resistant to fifty meters. As I was turning over this little-studied piece of Irish engineering, the kitchen table started shaking violently. I hit the ceiling. Collecting myself, I grabbed the cell phone and, making a mental note to never again use vibrate, calmly answered,        'Mule barn. Head ass speaking.'      'What time is it?' Fate rears its ugly head.      'I was just mulling over the idea of transatlantic time zone malfunctions--' I was unceremoniously interrupted by the drawl on the other end before I could finish my discourse on the mathematics of Irish whiskey drinking,       '--beer thirty!' Unused to horn conversations lasting this long, I felt diplomatic relations on the air waves becoming increasingly strained.         'I'm downstairs; get your ass down here before my truck floats away.' I didn't have time to look out the rain spattered window before I heard a click and was left holding the empty line. In a moment of questionable clarity I threw on my coat and grabbed a medicinal shot for the road, thinking that if I didn't get my ass downstairs the phone wouldn't be the only empty line I'd be left holding tonight. And besides, according to the Jameson bottle it was getting pretty late.       Only after I had climbed into my brother's party barge on wheels did I remember my promise to buy him beer tonight.      'How late does this taxi run?' I asked as we launched from the curb into modest traffic. The Jameson started to kick in just as we careened past a moving van that didn't seem to be moving at all.       'Store's gonna close we need a coupla cases.' Came the hurried reply.       'Shit! How many alcoholics you planning on feeding?' I tried to keep the waver out of my voice as we pulled into the oncoming lane to pass a slow moving Cadillac.       'Just you and me, bro.'      'Great. And I was hoping to masturbate in peace tonight.' The thought of throwing 'em back with my brother wasn't my first choice for a rain drenched Thursday; I really  was  looking forward to a little peace and quiet after recent events.             \n",

      "   ONE MONTH: In the Lives of Tony and Samantha  I was alone but attentive in Dolloff’s class, Until you walked in and stared at my ass.  I was shy but you made me smile; Flirtatious glances for a while.  Then it was off to the coffee shop, A long conversation I didn’t want to stop!  Soon approaching was Valentine’s Day, And that night I was swept away.  Every day from then was just me and you; It all seemed too good to be true.  A six hour-long phone conversation Left both of us filled with fascination.   Only three weeks, Florida, and the sun; An “I love you” and my heart was won.

      "      The Office  Prepares to Pontificate    The first week in November means two things for college football fans: time to decide how many birds to barbeque for Thanksgiving, and time to ask a blessing for that dressing of NCAA football turkey—bowl games.  How is my team doing this year? How can I get into the game?  Fortunately,  The Office  has answered the most important of these questions at  The Office  website-- the only resource for the consummate college fan. In a scant three weeks, Universities and fans alike will be preparing themselves for the cornucopia of football feasting:  2003 Rose Bowl Champions; 2003 Cotton Bowl Champs.  ‘Bowl Game Champions’ is a mouthful every fan loves to say, and every team loves to hear.  Cold weather, cold beverages and hot football are the bread and butter of college fans, and this season  The Office  is catering the party.  With bowl games already listed in  The Office's  inventory, fans can purchase their happiness now without the hassle of freezing lines at the stadium, or half hour phone calls, or last minute nail-biting.  When it comes down to brass tacks no fan should be left out in the cold; and no fan will be, after a quick stop by  The Office's  award winning website.   R,  The Office  CEO and all around live wire, has been larking about the office chanting, “It’s Bowl Game time, boys and girls.”  Ever the avid fan, he added that, “If we have to, we’ll sell every ticket we have-- except mine!”   The Office  already does brisk bowl game sales, with current figures hovering around $100,000 per bowl; at this rate, it looks to be another record breaking month in the millions for the Basement Crew.     The Office  also serves pre-bowlgame needs with a complete listing on their live online ticket buffet.  There are scads of football games left to be seen, and the easiest way to grab a slice of the pie is a quick stop at the  The Office's  homepage.  After all, those games aren’t going to watch themselves.   --Press Release, 2003  \n",

      "    Unexpected Sales Numbers for Rugby World Cup have Fans Scrambling  With a Month and a Half ‘til Kickoff,  The Office  Sells over a $ Quarter Million   With a little over a month ‘til Rugby World Cup 2003 kicks off in Sydney, fans worldwide are jumping on open seats for their favourite matches: the October 18th match, England v. S. Africa, is selling especially well as die-hard fans in the UK snap up tickets ranging anywhere from a $215 USD category B seat to the $350 USD category A spots.  The stadium in Perth, Australia is filled to capacity nigh two months out due to the popularity of the Club from England.  Who would have guessed such vigorous response so early in the year, but it has become obvious that now is the time to grab your favorite matches- before tickets disappear.   Match #38, Australia v. Ireland, is a red-hot match at  The Office , as the two clubs are expected to pitch a voracious battle-- and at an average $200 USD per seat who wouldn’t fancy seeing these boys play.  This match is one in a long line of reasons Australia runs a close second to the UK in daily traffic across  The Office's  busy storefront.   In a shining example of faith and dedication many a Britisher have purchased Finals tickets, in expectation of England carrying the Cup.  The November 15th semi’s match is going for an average $475 USD, while those astute enough to grab their premium Finals tickets now, are only paying anywhere from $500 to $1000 USD.   R,  The Office  CEO, was caught saying that, “Fan response this year is unprecedented,” to the extent that, “no one can afford to wait long as the rush for premium seating has turned into a full-on stampede of drooling, eager rugby Fans.”  And the largest part of those eager fans calls the United Kingdom home; the rest of  The Office's  10,000 visitors a day hail from Australia, the Africas, and America.  With the unprecedented number of tickets sold, to the demographically largest fan base in the world, only one thing is certain: a rivalry on this order will make for the most exciting Rugby World Cup in living memory.        --Press Release, 2003  \n",

      "   I am close to getting what I want right now if only I could resist the pressure of cracking, of trying to mend broken dreams simply because I have learned to live always holding on to someone else; so that when the time comes to stand on my own a little while I deteriorate to emotional horseshit and cast about for whatever life preserver might be found, which always happens to be the latest in a long line of failed relationships.  That the new-- the mist shrouded mount afar off, the tug on my heart strings, the Challenge and the Glory-- will sustain and nurture my otherwise horseshit doesn’t matter where my acquired dependency on third party emotions is concerned.  My life struggle, insofar as the term applies to this early breaking news sensation, seems to be finding the will power to move from one relationship to another. The only consolation I have in this particular case is the fact that though I am presently regressing, as is my manner, the relationship I'm moving into isn't a tried and failed one rather, it's one that was tried and then given a raincheck for more pressing matters.  In other words, the glimmer of half a chance awaits me at the end of this monotone rainbow, which makes for a far better shower than any I've previously endured. At this point I commence to dribbling on in broken english about the qualities of my current heart-lust and just what justifies us being together. Break out the violin, my friend.   --Originally penned Halloween Night, 2001; three minutes past Midnight.   \n",

      "   S  There's something I've always wondered, and now one of my close friends is in the position to let me in on the answer. What exactly do married women with children do on Friday nights? I'm going to go out on a limb and suppose it's the same thing unmarried, twenty-five year old guys do-- try to tie up all the loose ends we call life. Twenty-five year old guys named Tony, that is-- Mea culpa. The nice man in the white jacket didn't feed me my vitamins this morning so I may come off as a wee bit wound up. I must admit, before we get much further, that I am an uninhibited email junkie of the free-love school when it comes to letter writing. That is to say, you're not the only one lucky enough to receive an email from Super T tonight. And although it doesn't make up for the social hole I've dug myself into, I am kinda starting to get into this editorially obtuse writing spree. Too bad a masculine version of The Vagina Monologues would never catch on. Oh wait, that's my day to day. It wouldn't be fair to say I'm a mysogynist, as I spread my angst and apathy fairly between the sexes. Misanthropic, sometimes, I admit-- but I'm working on it. I met a girl with whom it would never work out. I went out last night and talked in an Irish accent the whole night. Again. It's getting old (already) but let me tell you, hiding behind an accent does wonders for my social security. Really fills up the ol' chutzpah tank. The ability to create and use a character in public- Irish or otherwise- provides a certain element of security, a mask if you will, that allows one to do and say that which would otherwise be impossible. Tony could never be the boyishly charming, handsome devil that Irish-Tony-from-Dublin is. Well, everything but the handsome part. I have opened my eyes by shutting them.  Yes, I'm sober. Somber, even. And no, these guns aren't loaded. Guess you've realized by now that I'm playing Oedipus to your Oracle, and if you read this booger 'til the end you probably deserve a medal. There's a medal shortage on right now though, so I'll give you the next best thing: and end to this helter skelter email. Si quando in hic mundo bellam puellam invenit...Gloriem diam! Well, not sure about that last part. I was a lousy Latin student. You took Italian so you can probably get the gist of it, or at least the jest of it.    Arrivederci mi angelo,  T   \n",

      "   Ed.'s note: The following is from a letter written by a good friend, Stacy. Being a Woman Herself, she should know what she's talking about. It has been edited for punctuation but otherwise left verbatum.   Girls are all the same. Give her just a little bit of fun and attention and then pull back again. Keep her wanting more and not getting it. That drives girls wild. Then when you know she is ready to have you and sacrifice for you, give her the whole thing. That is a girl's weakness. She needs to be wanted and when she feels she isn't getting that she will strive to earn it. If she is already wanted she will wander off to find someone else to want her. We are evil. We all want something new and exciting, something we can't have, and something everyone else wants. That is the bottom line of the good guys finish last scenario. You can get a good guy, but it is harder to get a player and it seems like the player has a lot of other people wanting him. Now that doesn't mean a girl wants a jerk. She wants a challenge that will then melt in her hands and let her feel like she has some power. Ok, so we are complicated creatures that play a few more games then men do. Men are a little easier, they want someone that will be a lady and look like a trophy and is fun to do a lot of activities with that will then go home behind closed doors and be a total slut. So, I guess if a girl can accomplish all of that she would be a catch. Unfortunately a lady is never a slut and a slut can't pretend to be a lady for very long.  \n",

Stepping out for the imposing peak Traversing the vast and friendless plain;         Echoing that voice that he hears speak            Of good and gloom in long refrain.                     At the foot for to size Up the mount with weary eyes; Troubled is he by Wind that cries 'Turn ye back, word to the wise'!                   Strength's been depleted by ceaseless gale Toiling against rock has made him weak; Deafened by distraction's constant wail Unable to find the soft spot he seeks.  Sadness unchanged tho' sorely dogged Yet stays his soul against the strain; Many more difficulties must be logged Before the peak he hopes to gain.  Looks ahead- is demonstriz'd By bully Rock that belies What trouble beyond lies In the path to paradise.  Turning 'round there is nothing to see 'Tween heaven almighty and earth so frail; Neither rose nor red bends listening ear To what news of hardship his journey entails.               The mount, afar, bred hollow determination In a heart youthful and callously unfear'd; Now bravery's dethroned by resignation To lonely despair and it's manifest tear.  Heart now sterilized Rose thought crystallized The truth, come to realize Is looking up at the skies!  No recourse but push on towards a dream For dying alone brings not salvation; Even goodness, sometimes, is not what it seems When heading for the land of re’onciliation.  Down to tall earth on still wind snow sails Lends to the silence an imperial theme; Drowsy, a tired traveler might hear it say 'Now sing you a lullaby- sing I your requiem.'  Hope is bent Soul is spent Curtain is rent Let me repent!  Sight gone with snow's soft silent regale On and on the path trips, winds its way; Rosy hope struggling- will it prevail? Against desperation's callous foray.  Presently the peak no longer daunts Across thick mist he barely can see Rocks, whose form on the shore haunt And past that his everbless'd salt sea!  It's apparent He was sent With intent Most fervent  As ocean, salt tears roll down his face Never a sight more joyous could be; Love lead to that which is now embrace'd The sight of his everbless'd salt sea.  In seas of change is Sadness epilogue'd First life, now death, each joyously faced Roses were right, in their dialogue Whispering pain, but speaking of grace.        \n",

      "   Rain softly spatters the pavement two stories below, beating a quiet, steady rhythm that is at once inspiring and depressing; how good it feels to see the world washed of its sin, to accept the tranquility imminently offered by nature's downpour and the heart's consequent outpour. But as the breast swells to the rinsing of the rain, what wasted chances in sunny days past are remembered!  The trickle, the stream, the rushing and gushing as soft silent drizzle drowns the floodgates of a memory burdened with its task of forgetting too slowly.  Love is a master of his craft, changing faces even with the changing faces of nature; the giddy child of this morning's bright-hot sunrise, the wizened elder that just this evening came knocking at your conscience; beating a quiet, steady rhythm- let me in, let me in- as you sit and listen to the rain.

      "   Sitting alone, I have naught to do But take it in stride and think of you. Raven's hair, tight with curls Bluest eyes, that's my girl; Sunset cheeks on freckled face Her heart with mine is interlaced.  Death, if ever our bond is broken! Upon that oath I pledge my token Of love. At times it may not show So I tell you now, that you may know I plan to hold you all my days Your heart and mine are interlaced.  Solitude had been my friend- He and I to the bitter end. Then I left him for another Remember me, Oh my Brother; Forgive me but I've found my place Her heart and mine are interlaced.  Mindy I want to apologize For falling short in your eyes All the times a piece of your heart I've torn off and shredded apart. I have them here: 'twasn't a waste Because our hearts are interlaced.  If you'll have me, take my hand I'll show you life, all that I can I want you to find in me All the things in you I see Together we'll journey to that place You and I-- we're interlaced.      \n",

      "   S,  I love how this world works if one allows it to. It's a quarter of eleven Sunday night and I checked my email thinking that I should write you because it's been so long since we've talked, I shouldn't neglect friends like that, and I know you don't write unless it's your turn. Well guess who shows up in my inbox. I am more than a little moved, as well as awestruck. Since we've been off of our daily routine, let me bring you up to speed: I spent four days worriedly cramming for my real estate exam, which I sat for and passed with flying colors last Tuesday morning; I've been engrossed in applications and interviews the past two weeks; in the middle of last week, after zero success in the job hunt, I came very, very near to selling everything I own to buy a sailboat in San Diego, move to Southern Cali maybe build houses for awhile to make money, then take off for Hawaii by way of Cabo San Lucas, where I have a contact. Well Thursday I scored an interview and an hour into it they made an offer I couldn't refuse. So as of Friday I work for the biggest real estate company in central Texas. Now that may sound like a lot, but my life has felt surprisingly slow these past couple days, which makes me wonder if it's the whole life-passing-before-my-eyes routine and I'm dying slowly-- maybe I shouldn't have postponed the dream just to stick my hand in the cookie jar. Considering in the last year and a half I've turned into a worrier extraordinaire, that kind of doubt makes for good bedtime contemplation. Oh and I got a cat. Named Cat. Or kitty-kitty, or stinkin' cat, or blackstuff, or whatever comes to mind when it goes to nibbling on my toes expecting breakfast at five. So you get a new schedule, an extra day off to work on the house and really put down roots, grow, whatever you want to call it, and 250 miles and a lifetime away, I pick up the slack and start working six days a week full time. There is a rhythm to this world-- you just have to stop listening so hard in order to hear it. Well Sunday is the day of rest and that's just what I've done. I don't feel particulary rich in the coin of the spirit, nor particulary poor. I'm not sure yet if I've done the right thing, but I've done something and that, when your name is Tony West, is most of the time all that you can ask. I Can't tell you, babe, how fine it is to hear from you, and I was honestly about to write! Now that you have more time, you should visit; and when I come to my senses and pull stakes for parts unknown I'll be sure to stop by and see you on my way out. Kinda like agreeing to get married at 25 if nothing else comes along. It was Herman Melville who said, 'Do not forsake the dreams of thy youth.' When I was young I had a new dream every week; happiness was doing it all. These days I wish I could do something- anything- productive, since happiness tends to be fleeting at best. And I may get the chance yet: all anyone has to do is stop listening so hard and let things happen. I promise I'll write more often.  Yours,  Tony   \n",

      "   Dull, aching pain has wrought its woe Throughout the deeds of my life; I have embraced the slippery foe And for it I get the knife.  Long did I stand By the works of my hands And now those hands, they stab me.  The world I met was full of strife Sheltered though I may have been; In my youth my mind was rife With thoughts of how I might sin. Long have I stood On hill and in wood And now those woods won't have me.  From the outset I have looked for the end But the end, it is elusive; My life as it were, has been a condemned One of a search most fruitless. Heaven or Hell? The which I guessed well Because Hell is where you've found me.   \n",

      "                 In Athens, we visited the market which was mostly a meat market and the smell was absolutely appalling. A butcher pulled me aside so we could have a picture together with his pig. We had lunch in a small place within the market where the smell continued to waft in and I had no appetite from all the sites and sounds. Before I knew it, a 40-something man there was asking Dr. Romanos permission to ‘caress’ me so he bought us all wine and chicken and when we were leaving he handed me a dead fish, fully intact. I did not know what to do with it. His counterpart, who took our picture with his photo phone, had a toupee that was so warn it actually had a significant bald spot. We wanted to visit the archaeological sites on Sunday, but it was voting day and everything was closed but the huge flea market which was neat. Monday we visited the Acropolis and the Agora AND managed to go shopping – much better than Ohio shopping.                \n",

From our room, Hayfaa and I have a view of the mountain, if we venture to the roof, the ocean is on the other side. We are not living near the caldera, but we will spend so many days there that it is not to be missed. We have only had good luck (except I got into trouble already with some wild dogs). On the boat ride, a miscommunication between our travel agent, Santorini, and the boat people ended in cabins and dinner with the captain – a 4 course meal. When we arrived to Santorini, we were treated to breakfast at a café and driven to our absolutely enormous house. Two persons per room, each with its own bathroom and veranda. A new refrigerator, stove, clothes washer, and then yesterday, we came home to find our refrigerator completely packed, along with the cupboards, and the storage area. Our dining room was full of every item you would need to entertain a party of twenty. And to add to all of this, we got Susana, our cook and maid. We will be given the opportunity to spend each Saturday on a different island in the cyclades as guests of an official we’re working with. The beach is a 10 minute walk, we’re on the side with black sand but we haven’t had time to go yet. Yesterday we had a tour bus take us to the different settlements and environments found on the island. Please take a look at the pictures – I’ve uploaded a few.                \n",

It is so amazing how I felt like I was in America as we drove into the city - same highways, billboards, big box stores, American music on the radio. But when we got into the city, it was so different. Everything is under construction for the olympics. Working on sidewalks, roads, and building fronts everywhere. And there are guards with rifles patrolling the large buildings (I think this is normal). We went to a taverna last night and had great food with wonderful wine, I think we were the only foreigners there. Today will be spent wandering around Plaka, seeing the sites, and learning this part of the city. I will upload the photos next time I get to an internet cafe.

      "       So I'm walking home from school today and guess who I see: Steve Ivcich.  Except it wasn't Steve Ivcich.  It was Steve Ivcich, just 15 years younger.  And he wasn't named Steve Ivcich.  This is yet again another example of me seeing someone who I know except just at a different age.  For example, last summer I did my community service hours at Ronald McDonald House, which is this place by Children's Memorial Hospital that gives free room and board to people who don't live in the area but don't know when they can return home because their kid has a disease, is badly injured, etc.  So the grounds kept at the Ronald McDonald house is named some name I can't remember, but I know his name wasn't Zandy.  Except the weird thing is that this guy looked EXACTLY like Zandy, except 30 years older.  Same voice, same face, same sense of humor, the whole 9 yards (speaking of 9 yards, I remember this conversation I had a while back about the origin of that phrase and is has something to do with escaping from prisons.)  So It's the present day, and yet their are two identical version of the same person(s), except they are of different ages.  And have different names.  Another example: So I have to go to get a hair cut cause my dad turns into a Fundamentalist when my hair gets to long so I had no choice but to cut it.  So I'm off to the Hair Cuttery, the one on Wells and Eugenie to be exact, and I go inside and put my name down and take a seat.  So I wait around 15 or so minutes and then this lady tells me to come back.  Now this ain't any ordinary lady, this is the one and only Chuck.  Yes, the Chuck from Narsty, the Chuck that's George's friend, the one we all only kinda know and yet still love.  Except once again, it isn't really Chuck.  It's Chuck all right, but 10 years older.  And she ain't named Chuck.  But other then those two recurring factors, they are one in the same.  They listen to the same frickin' music, and not only that, she even told me about how she went to the last Bad Brains concert, and how it sucked cause they played only their most famous shit and then a bunch of their Reggae/Rock/Jazz fusion stuff (Not that that has anything to do with Chuck herself, but it just shows that she has common sense.) If you haven't caught on yet, then let me put the bib on for ya (Red Lobster is overrated.) (like sushi.)  All of these examples and stories that I have just given you have one 'thing' in common.  This one 'thing' holds all the pieces of this mysterious puzzle together, and gives it its meaning.  This one 'thing' has somehow been able to take all of these stories and make them possible; this one 'thing' is the glue that holds the pizza pie to the plumber's ass. Until the moment this afternoon when I was walking home from school and I saw Steve Ivcich but I really hadn't, I had always wondered what the one special thing about this 'thing' really was.  I had always known this 'thing' to be this 'thing', and yet I always knew that this 'thing' had some other purpose, agenda, special thing about this 'thing' that always seemed to make weird things happen involving this 'thing' that no one could explain.  And then, after I passed the Steve Ivcich that wasn't Steve Ivcich, I realized what was the thing about this 'thing.' This 'thing' had the ability to warp our own ideas about people, and reshape them to give us a new understanding of these people.  These people are the ones I spoke of.  They were once but people I knew, but I didn't really know em'.  Now I don't exactly feel like I know know em', but I don't feel like a stranger.  And yet I have also realized that this 'thing' truly isn't someone different then ourselves.  This 'thing' in fact holds no superpowers at all, No exotic/erotic voodoo magic, No complex personality that people can't understand, in fact, the only extraordinarily Amazing Thing about This 'Thing' Is IT's BLINDing, CHAOS Causing, TUSUNAMI Trembling, ABSOLUTELY RAVISHING SEXINESS!  This 'Thing' is none other then George Ivcich. p.s. By Sexiness I mean [crowd whisper's in Nikesh's ear]... Sexiness          \n",

      "       I am now making a call to you all: (call meaning plead) Please tell people about this blog! Why you ask?  What's in it for me? A: What if I told you I would pay you to write for this blog if I could get enough daily visitors, more then just the people we know directly. Sounds good right?  To good to be true? Just take a look at www.Gizmodo.com That sight is owned by a guy who just lives off the advertisements on his weblog.  That's it. Well you say, why would anyone want to read this blog?  It sucks now anyway, no good or interesting readable content anyway. Fair enough.  But how about this:  what's the one thing that always holds my plans and ideas back from being carried forward?  The answer my friends is money. So what if I got enough money from the ads to finance my projects, and then I wrote about them in the blog?  People would sure as hell read that.  And then I could start putting up movies and pictures and eventually the traffic on the site would be so great that not only could I finance bigger projects, I could also turn in an actual profit from the blog.  By the way, the blog by this time would have a real webpage, not this free one I'm on now.  And then the I would become WE, and then WE could have simultaneous projects going on and it would be fucking crazy!  Pay your way through college, give you something to put on your resumé, something to right your thesis on.  And now I want to address one issue that I think separates me and those who believe in my ideas from those who immediately cast them off and say, 'That aint gonna happen.'  Just think about what we could do.  Don't think about how were gonna get there, just think about how kick ass it would be when everything is set up and flowin'.  Just let the ideas flow, and don't let reality hold you back, cause reality is just what society makes you think is realistic.  There are no boundaries when it comes to these Ideas.  Yes, Ideas is capitalized.  Just fucking forget about how 'unrealistic' things are for once.  Let your imagination run wild in a field where everything you could possibly need to make your idea come true is at your fingertips.  'Realistic' is meaningless.  Welcome to my world.  Let your mind wonder and don't be afraid/ashamed/fell stupid to think about things that societydoesn'tt accept or you think other people will reject you for. That'ss the best part about thinking, cause no one can intrude on you or invade your privacy.  All your thoughts are personal and private, and most importantly, unrestricted.  This may sound like the same old bullshit they tell you in preschool except this actually has some value.  These ideas give you a new direction in life.  I can't tell you how many times I change my opinion on topics after thinking about them.  I'm like a supermodel going through Menopause.  Damn that's a good quote.  Niccolo Machiavelli once proposed, 'The ends justifies the means.'  No they don't, cause the means are always justified if the ends are productive and meaningful. Productive and meaningful you say?

And no, world hunger and war are not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about vanity and society: people are to self conscious and AFRAID that they'll fuck up in life.  Why do you think we have so much more homework as students now then our parents did 30-40 years ago.  They say we have to work harder, cause the world is more competitive now then it was before.  But that's because people don't sit back and say, 'Hey! Hey.....'  Today with live two lives: One in the present, and one in the future.  People are pressured into living in the future, by being forced to do hard work now, so that you'll do better in the future.  But what happens when that future gets here?  Then you need to talk about your 401k plan, how to invest for your retirement.  And what about when that future gets here, your retirement?  Then you think about your death, how your family is going to support itself, your will.  And then that future arrives.  What are you gonna plan after that?  Nothing.  To bad you realized on your death bed that instead of living in the future you could have spent your time in the present.  Cared for your family.  Had fun with your friends.  Loitered in the time you had, the time that never felt like it would run out.  Haven't people realized?  80 years is a long fucking time.  But what happens when you do live in the present only?  Well fucking look at me: 3 pills a day, a visit to the therapist once a week, a trip to the psychiatrist quarterly, and a piece of shit high school. And I wouldn't give that shit up for anything.  So what if you get hell for you decisions.  Live in the present.  Fuck the stiff.  Lets TANGO!          \n",

      "       I, SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE UNIVERSE AND ALL UNDERLINGS, NIKESH PATEL, HEREBY OPEN CASE FILE #38027-1: STUPID RULE OF SOCIETY #1: FORMAL CLOTHING  Formal clothing makes me sick.  Not only does it not serve any purpose whatsoever, it just makes everyone else's life chaotic and tense.  Not only has formal clothing changed our culture for the worse, I believe it could single handedly plunge our society back into the Dark Ages.  Now don't get me wrong, I still think penguin tuxes kick ass.  But I never said I hated clothing in general, I just hated 'formal clothing.'  A tux is just another article of clothing, which in theory should be worn just as much as any everyday t-shirt or pair of pants (minus the fact that they are next to impossible to clean and cost a fuck load of money.)  But affix the adjective 'formal' in front of clothing, and all hell breaks loose.  I will start first by addressing why so many people in our society disagree with me, and then why they are in fact mentally extinct dopes.  A large percentage of our population, predominantly middle-class families with some sort of religious faith, attends functions that require formal dress and would not question it in a heartbeat.  They believe that at these functions, such as weddings, bar/bat mitzvahs, and benefits, formal clothing is appropriate and it is rude not to wear it.  They do not want to appear shabby, rugged, or god forbid informal.  However, these people have yet to realize one fatal flaw with their reasoning: what is defined as shabby, rugged, or informal?  And by whom?  The answer to this, my underlings, is not only simple, it is written on captain obvious him self’s t-shirt.  Shabby, rugged, and informal clothing is defined by a person’s perception of what society deems appropriate.  So if these people believe that society considers t-shirts, baggy pants and fishnet stockings shabby, rugged and informal, then whom did society get this idea from?  The answer to this, my feline friends, is human nature.  What?  Human nature?  What the fuck does the nature of humans have to do with why formal clothing is the bane of human civilization?  It has everything to do with it.  Humans are many things, but most importantly humans are greedy.  Oh wait you say, but I'm not greedy.  You may not think so, but greed is an essential part of human survival, and we would absolutely not be the dominant species on this planet if we weren't.  Oh hold it right there you accuse, I give my old clothes to homeless shelters and volunteer in my community.  Good for you I say, you should feel good about yourself.  But answer this question: Do you eat?  Of course you say, I eat because food is necessary for my survival.  And I say sure it is, but what about the child starving in the third world country with an economy that can barely support its corrupt government, doesn't that child need food to survive?  Or the homeless man outside your door and around the corner, sitting in his rain-soaked cardboard shelter: is food not necessary for his survival?  And you say yes, but it's unrealistic to give them my food, for I can't ship my dinner plate without the food spoiling, and plus it would cost too much anyway.  And the hobo down the street is high on crack anyway, so he doesn't want my food, and he smells anyway.  And I say to you, there, there is your greed.  And then you respond, but I give my $85, week-old cardigan to homeless shelters because they have gone out of fashion, and I give $5 to UNICEF on my yearly flight to Cancun, Mexico, where I spend 10 days at a beach resort, forgetting all my worries as I relax in a town where a town a few miles away 80% of the population lives below the poverty line.  And I say, there, there is your greed.  And you retort, well look at you!  Who ever said you were perfect, Mr. All high and mighty, steals from the poor and gives to the rich?!  And I say, no one.  No one ever said I was perfect, or any different than you.  No one said I was the Messiah, no one declared that I stood for all that is good and just.  And yet it is I that says, there, there is your greed.  And you scream to me, BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME!  Do you want me to run out into the rain, and treat the hobo as I would myself, and give him my own food?!  Should I vacuum-seal my dinner plate, and ship it to a boy in Mozambique?  Should I take the costs out my own paycheck, and send my tax refunds to the homeless shelter half way across town.  And I say no.  I say no because you are indeed correct, those things are unrealistic.  But what do I want from you?  I want you to admit that you are greedy, that you are human just like the rest of us, that greed is a key segment of human nature, that you and I are both physical embodiments of greed.  AND YOU YELL WITH FRUSTRATION, BUT WHAT DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHY FORMAL CLOTHING WILL EVENTUALLY BURY OUR CULTURE IN A BACKWARDS DOOM OF CHAOS AND CORRUPTION IF IT IS NOT ELIMINATED?!  And I say, damn bitch hold your fucking horses, I haven't even gotten to the point yet.  Let's recap: society got the idea that t-shirts, baggy pants and fishnets are shabby, rugged and informal from human nature.  Human nature is reflected through our actions as humans, and humans are greedy.  This means that human nature has a pure element of greed.  So how did the greed in human nature define what clothes are considered informal, rugged and shabby?  The questions, my dear Watson, is not how the greed in human nature defined certain clothes as informal, rugged and shabby, but rather how the greed in human nature made a separation between formal and shabby, rugged and informal clothing in the first place, and for what purpose.  So first we must ask ourselves why the greediness in humans would want to establish a concept of formal and informal clothing.  Chew on this: Can greed be greedy for greed?  Let me put it in context: a businessman is the head of a relatively large company, with a great deal of capital potential.  Let's take the one and only Enron for example.  The businessman is the CEO of Enron, the head hancho, the king of the hill, the full Monty, the big lé mooch.  However, he lives in a moderate sized house, in a normal, middle-class neighborhood in the city.  His kids go to public school and his wife works part time at the local preschool.  He is greedy in the sense that he makes sure that he claims enough resources for himself so that he can keep his family living comfortably without many worries, whether those be financial or safety-wise.  But at a primal level, greed is always something that strives for more.  So let's say that the businessman somehow comes to a point where he is offered a lucrative set of stock options, ones that are sure to have high returns.  Now the businessman's primal greed starts to take over.  He now wants more money, a more lavish life style, a penthouse downtown, a Bentley and a private jet, a hot secretary to fuck on the side.  But in order to get these wishes of his, he must lose his morality and ethics and make decisions that will ruin other people's lives.  This is the question: Can the business man's greed actually strive for more greed, so that it can reach those goals, or can the business man's greed be greedy enough to make those decisions on its own?  Or can the man's greed be greedy enough to make others greedy for him, and then make the decisions to cover up his ass.  Can his greed be greedy at all?  Is this question fundamentally flawed?  The answer to these questions are open to interpretation, however the bottom line is that the business man has the ability to move from his current moral high ground to the corrupt corporate scoundrel that we all know of.  And this is where everything else comes into play.  The founders of our society were men like these.  And by founders I do not mean our Founding Fathers, no.  Thomas Jefferson was long dead by the time our cultures real founders started making changes.  The founders of our society were corporate shmucks.  They didn't give a hoot about the future, except along the lines of financial prosperity.  They wanted more, and they used our society to get it.  It was these founders that introduced the ideas that shaped our society's ideas of formal and informal clothing.  Why?  In order to understand this, we must first understand the affects formal clothing has had on our society.  One anomaly that you might have run into already is that formal clothing is not something recent.  Formal clothing has been around since the days when feudalism still was the way of the land in Europe, and chivalry was still livin' strong.  In reality, formal clothing was even more predominant back then than it is now.  But when I say that the idea of formal clothing in our society originated with big business, I mean the new meaning of formal clothing.  This meaning, what I shall call the purpose of formal clothing, is what I hate.  It is the new purpose of formal clothing, the one created by big business, which has screwed over our culture.  Screwed over?  What the fuck does he mean by screwed over?  What I mean by screwed over is how formal clothing has fundamentally changed how our society functions, and why our culture is only suffering from these changes.  Let me break this issue down into 3 easy to swish-and-spit sections: 1.) Past Motives 2.) Present Affects 3.) Future Implications Shall we start in order...  Le Numero Uno: Past Motives The motives of the founders of our society not only had many clear and precise long-term goals, they also had a whole slew of short-term objectives that they kept in mind when introducing their new interpretation of formal clothing.  What was their interpretation of formal clothing?  To them, formal clothing was a tool they could use to manipulate large percentages of the population, and implement new and lasting cultural paradigms.  Big business, i.e. the founders of our society, were as smart as they were exploitive.  They reshaped our idea of formal clothing not all at once in one large brainwashing scheme, but over a period of time where it would go more or less unnoticed.  They introduced their 'tool' into American society during key changing points in our culture.  The most recent of these introduction periods was during the Great Depression.  We all know that big business leased huge sums of money to the government, and in doing so bought themselves a small part of our country.  How small?  Where?  I, ladies and gentlemen, am talking about a 1/8 of the little place we call Washington D.C.  They bought power in our government, and used it to make small changes in this country.  What were these small changes?  That remains a mystery, as only big business knew what they themselves were up too entirely.  However, their motives were known.  What did they want formal clothing to do for them?  First of all, formal clothing could pressure the middle class, as well as the lower classes, into holding themselves to a standard that was set by the upper class.  By this I mean that in the old old old days, all the rich people ALWAYS wore formal clothes.  There wasn't an alterative.  Now, with formal clothing as a required commodity at important functions, people in the lower/middle classes began to hold themselves to this same standard, that only the noble and well off dressed in their formal clothes, and to walk into a ball in jeans and a t-shirt made you look like a 'ruffian,' a no good lowlife.  big business likes this mentality, and they can use it to their advantage.  Wait a second, Modesty?  What about MTV and whore like... well, whores!  Let's travel back in time to a little period called the Elizabethan Era.  Now, what was one thing that women did back in this time?  They covered their bodies from chin to toe in clothing.  Nothing could show, except for the front of the face and MAYBE the hands (gasp!)  Why did they do this?  Cause previously, people had been runnin' around with their clothes practically flyin off, and modesty was shot to hell.  And eventually people became disgusted with it and decided that everything must go: No more public orgies, multiple wives, scantly clad clothing, Michael Jackson... the list goes on.  And this created a cycle.  Eventually people got mad because of all the conservative influences that were taking the fun out of life, so people started showing more skin again.  Now, what is better for a business financially: being able to predict trends in society, or being able to predict trends in society?  Not only could the business profit off these trends, they could guarantee that it would happen over and over again!  So, you ask, how does formal clothing create this trend?  As I said before, formal clothing instilled ideas in our heads of what is and isn’t appropriate in certain situations.  Eventually these ideas became intertwined and swing either way, which dictates the current phase of the trend we are in.  If the formal clothing idea swings into that of what is informal, then we have a new conservative ear in our culture.  If it goes the other way, then sex is in.  Now, we all know that adults do not dictate these trends single handedly, no sir-ree.  This is where the youth come in.  The adults are the people who begin the initial swing, but it is the youth that carries it out.  If the youth are liberal horny sex machines, then the adults become more conservative.  Since the adults control the government and society, they push a conservative, modest influence into society.  Then the adults die off, and the youth become the adults, and their children become the next youth.  However the conservative influence remains from the previous adults, the new youth grow up in this conservative lifestyle.  Then this generation of youth gets fed up with the censorship, and introduces liberal reforms.  This process repeats, and we have the trend that big business profits off of.  Let me also get it straight that this trend does not occur as quickly as I just explained it.  This cycle repeats maybe once, twice, even possible three times at the most during a century.  Big business could still use this to their advantage, by controlling the media to keep the trend going, and even make it stronger.  These, my underlings, were the factors that motivated the founders of our culture to introduce their spin on formal clothing.  Le Numero Dos: Present Affects I'm scared.  Not only am I scared, I am empowered.  It is the threat that is currently facing our generation that has empowered me.  I cannot sit here, twiddling my thumbs without thinking how fast our culture is going down the toilet, and yet nobody seems to care.  Adults Are Oblivious, Children Are Ignorant, politicians are happy.  Not All politicians, But The Ones Who Choose To Ignore The Threat Of Our Impending Doom.  Our society is in a headlock, crippling under the pressure of Gun-Ho fuckers without a sense of future.  Hello, were not in faking Kansas anymore.  We never WERE in goddamn Kansas.  Fuck Kansas.  The word Kansas really looks like a piece of shit word too after you stare at it for a while.  Let me indulge you on the current destructive forces milling at our society.  We are headed into another turn of the knob.  Yes, the other phase of the trend.  The omens are everywhere you look: MTV, national thong sales, George Bush, gay marriage, the war in Iraq- these things all add up to one thing; conflict.  And when we hit conflict, all goes to hell.  We are living in a liberal society for the most part, in terms of cultural ideals.  But that is quickly changing.  BAMM! The Supreme Court puts George Bush in office.  BAMM! Enron collapses.  BAMM! 9/11 scares the suburbanites shitless.  BAMM! Bush lies to Americans to get revenge on the guy who tried to assassinate his daddy.  BAMM! Janet Jackson’s tit falls out during the Super Bowl.  BAMM! Clear Channel drops Howard Stern after being fined by the FCC.  BAMM! Malpractice insurance rates driving doctors out of business because of frivolous lawsuits.  BAMM! Emeril adds some more butter; the U.S. gets fatter.  WAKE UP AND SMELL THE GASOLINE FOLKS!  Oh wait, THERE ISN'T ANY!  We are returning to the Conservative agenda that screwed over our country years ago, and American is just letting it slide right fucking by.  Formal Clothing has given a medium for the conservative media to exploit us.  FOX NEWS! GETTIN THE CONSERVATIVE BLUES!  While the Catholic Church rapes your brother and NOBODY GIVES A SHIT!  MAYBE ONCE THEY SEE THE SHIT ON HIS FACE THEY'LL START CARIN'!  And Despite these horrible realities, there is still hope.  Howard Dean kicked ass, except he wouldn't have gotten elected.  Michael Moore is the shiznit, but that whole Disney thing was kinda shabby.  WHERE IS RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE WHEN WE NEED THEM!  Change is possible, but it takes work, time, balls, guts, Benjamins, and a face.  If we don't start making changes soon, then in 60 years when were old and shriveled we'll have to say, 'Yep, formal clothing led to the downfall of our society.'  How pathetic is that.  Le Numero Tres: Future Implications The systematic brainwashing of our society led by formal clothing must be stopped.  If we do not band together to fight this greater evil, then it will lead our culture into a new Dark Age, where all of the progress we have made in recent years will be lost.  How?  The Question my underlings is not How is it going to destroy our society, for that is quite obvious.  The Question should be, What can we do about it?  But considering I’ve already written this much it’ll probably take me a couple more days to explain this part.  So instead, I will answer the How questions.  How will it lead us into a Dark Age.  Let me lay it out for ya'.  As our society becomes more conservative, people will begin to where formal clothing everywhere, not just at important functions.  So what’s the big deal. you say.  The big deal is that suddenly the control factor is gone.  Before, big business always dictated the trend of liberalism to conservativism in our culture.  But not fashion trends.  But you, you say, fashion trends change with current political trends, like how scantly-clad clothes are more popular during liberal times, while turtle necks and collars are more common in conservative times.  I say sure, but wait a second.  Formal clothing, unlike all other common clothing that we wear today, carries along an impression with it.  People think that formal clothing separates them from the rest of the masses, that for the time they are wearing it they suddenly have some higher importance.  These ideas have lasted through trends, and do not dissolve.  So if formal clothing becomes everyday clothing, then these ideas will become everyday also.  But hold up, you say.  Why hasn't formal clothing become the dominant choice for common clothing before?  Because we never had a chance to stick with it.  Think back: World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam.  But not Iraq.  Why not?  Because of terrorism.  Terrorism is a threat to our nation that people can't comprehend, so instead they leave it up to their leaders. Mr. President, why is my daddy dead?  Because he realized how great his country was, and that he was willing to do anything to make sure that the people of his country and you would live better lives.  But why is he dead Mr. President?  I don’t understand.  Well son, your dad was fighting some very bad, evil people.  These people threatened this country.  They threatened him, her, them, this people of this city, of this entire country- and you.  And you were the most important thing to him, so he decided to fight to the end, just for you.  But whom was he fighting?  People who hate freedom son, people who don't understand what is so great about life here in America.  Where are they?  Did he make them go away?  Well son, these people are everywhere, and your dad was fighting a group of them.  There are so many, that this country has to draft your older brother to fight too.  Just for you, son.  Just for you.  but when will they go away Mr. President, when?  When they realize how great freedom is.  That's when.  And when will that be?  Soon son, soon.  What can I do to help?  Ha-ha, well your only 5.  You'll have to wait another 13 years if you want to enlist.  But when your old enough, I'm sure you'll know what the right thing to do is.  But what can I do now?  I wanna to help now!  Stay alert son!  If you see anything that doesn’t look right, then tell an adult.  Do your part now, and you could save millions of people lives, just like your dad.  Gee thanks Mr. President!  I almost forgot that my dad died in a war that didn't have a clear enemy, goal or purpose!  I can't wait to sacrifice my life for a lying, manipulating bastard like yourself when I'm old enough!  But until then, I'll just pretend I live in late 18th century France and your Maximilien Robespierre, and instead of this being the War on Terror, it's the Reign of Terror!  And its my job as a responsible citizen to make sure I tell the government whenever some talks bad about you, Mr. President, because your just a good person and they don't believe in freedom if they don't like you!  I love my country! Do you want the next youth generation to grow up like this?  In our modern world, when people willingly decided to do stupid shit like this, and embrace conservative values, formal clothing reign supreme.  It will rise up, unstoppable because it is imposed on our society not by big business, which can moderate it, but by ourselves.  If formal clothing becomes commonplace, so will conservative values.  The Church will gain power, scientific progress will end, and military progress will proceed.  The remnants of the fun culture that we lived by, the truly free culture, will all but disappear.  And society will pause in progress, and begin to reverse.  Everything that we learned, our computer technology, our world connectivity, our world languages, our writing, our knowledge, our freedom, will undo itself.  We will forget everything, leaving nothing but uniformity and a homogenous society.  The freedom that we attempted to preserve will be gone.  Nothingness will become everything.  This, ladies and gentle men, I call the Tivo Affect.   I have shown you how formal clothing came about as a tool of big business in our culture, how it affects us today, and how it is gradually unwinding the delicate thread of our civilization.  And if I could replace the mindset that governs formal clothing in the brains of people, I would replace it with this new logic:  End the homogeneousness.  Do not strive to be the same; leap to be different.  Embrace the eccentric, outcast the followers.  Do not call people Posers, cause the only Posers are the people that call people Posers (-the words of Mark Gonzales).  Individuality is the answer, not the reject idea.  Fuck the stiff.  Love the new.  And don't forget to pimp out in those penguin tuxes.          \n",

At least not really.  It's an idea about the ideas I have for projects. What is the one problem that I  ALWAYS  have when it comes to projects? The lack of funding.  I have no cash for this shit.  This is what my semi-epiphany is about. I don't like to restrict myself, so previously I have avoided setting any perameters for what I can and cannot do.  This time however, I'm giving myself one tinsy winsy restriction: a budget.  This time the sky ain't the limit in the financial department.  From now on I will be working only on stuff that is very cost efficient and organized.  This is completely different from what I've done before.  Here's my issue:  because of my new restriction, I will have to put all of my previous projects on indefinite hold.  These include but are not limited to:    The Pimped out, rocket/motorcycle engine powered Radio Flyer   The Pirate Radio Station   Turning my upper deck into a Pirate ship (see above)   Making my room the epicenter of Modern design and counterculture   Transforming into the Urban Cowboy    Although I am sad that I have to put these projects on hold, I'm glad that I have a new path and frontier to conquer, and a fresh start to keep me motivated.

One day, this duck went to see his uncle.  When he saw his uncle outside his house fishing, the duck quacked, 'Uncle!'  The little duck's uncle looked up and saw his nephew, and greeted him with open wings.  Then a hunter shot the uncle.  And so the little duck ran back to his home and called the FBI.  Soon a crime seen was setup where the shooting had occured.  Apparently this was not the first shooting, and the FBI was already hot on the tail of the renegade hunter.  And so the FBI asked Congress to pass a bill that would require all citizens to have an I.D. card, that they must carry with them at all times.  This way, the FBI could track down the hunter easier.  Soon the FBI needed mroe help, and called the CIA.  They put a spending bill through Congress as part of the Department of Defenses 'Black Budget' that would allow them to tap and record all phone, mail, and electronic forms of communication without authorization.  Soon the FBI caught the hunter, and publicised the story widely, to gain public support for the agency.  However, even though renegade hunters were not at large and crime rates were down to an all time low, the FBI and CIA asked Congress to repass the old bills.  Congress did as they were told, fearing that questioning the bill would cause them to loose public support in the next election.  And so the little duck grew old, and soon he became an uncle as well.  But he was run over by a semi on I-94, and was squashed like a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich in a second graders lunch.

      "             Well, the 9-11 Commission is at it again, and today, Rudy Giuliani was on the menu.  For the most part, the overly critical bunch of hypocrites on the panel were pretty polite to the once hero of the day.  The real story here is the families of the victims of the tragedy.   'My son was murdered because of your incompetence!' shouted Sally Regenhard, whose firefighter son died in the trade center. Seated three rows behind Giuliani, she jabbed her finger at the former mayor and waved a sign that read 'Fiction' as he gave the city's emergency response a glowing review.   This woman, obviously saddened by her loss fails to realize that her son, in fact, died because terrorists flew planes into buildings - not because of the Mayor's incompetence.  This woman seems to have forgotten that Giuliani didn't fly any planes into any buildings, and that's the problem with a lot of people in America right now.  Everyone is so hung up in the politicization of this that they have forgotten who the real enemy is.     The report (The commission released two reports that mark the most comprehensive probe to date of New York's response on Sept 11) led to an aggressive interrogation of Giuliani's top fire, police and emergency management officials Tuesday, with Republican appointee John F. Lehman, a former Navy secretary under President Reagan, calling the failings 'a scandal' and 'not worthy of the Boy Scouts.'   Lehman told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the comments were misunderstood and that he was not trying to criticize those who led the Sept. 11 effort.   This seems to me to be a pretty cut and dry statement, and I think it's pretty clear who Lehman was talking about here.  If he wasn't trying to criticize those who led the effort, then who was he talking about?  Who was involved in a scandal?  Who's not worthy of the Boy Scouts?  We need to get to the bottom of this!  If it wasn't police, firemen, and local officials he was talking about, then who was it?  I want to know what could possibly be misunderstood from that.    The bottom line here is that this guy, just like the rest of these back-peddling pinheads, is trying to put on a show for the cameras.  They want to point the finger, and use powerful words like 'outrage' and 'disgrace' without the backbone  to take responsibility for anything themselves.   Later, Giuliani was chastised by members of the public. A longtime city gadfly berated him and the commission, yelling, 'Three thousand people murdered does not mean leadership!' He and another person were hustled out of the room.    Others in the audience shouted about the failure of Fire Department radios, shouting, 'Talk about the radios!   It's obvious why this guy was hauled out of the room.  What leadership could the mayor have possibly been able to provide in the midst of this disaster that would have prevented the loss of 3000 lives?  Again, a sad case of misguided anger.  He should be upset at the leadership of those who want to destroy our way of life, not those who serve to protect it.  I also have not heard anything to the effect that Giuliani, or anyone on his staff for that matter, built the radios that the fire department uses.  How quickly we forget about the communications nightmares of that day.  The trade towers had gobs of antennas on top of them.   Cell phones up and down the east coast were down, along with local telephones, cable, and yes, radios.  I can't wait for these people to start filing lawsuits against Motorola for wrongful death.  In my opinion, the mayor did a tremendous job managing this disaster, and should be commended.  I wouldn't have traded places with him for anything, and I doubt that anyone else in this country would have either.  Anyone who lived through Sept. 11th has now, essentially, lived in two different worlds.  Hindsight is 20/20, and I don't see what good it's going to do for this commission to sit and look for a scapegoat in our government.  Just like Pearl Harbor, this has changed the way we think, and so we must change the way we act.  Nobody wants another three thousand of our brothers and sisters to die.  We can't lose sight of who is at fault here.  The final report that this commission generates will not save a single life.  The only thing at this point that can save lives is the extermination of these radical Islamic pests, and paperwork and commissions can't do that - our military  can .

      "         Dead End    (3 1/2 SK)    The fact is I’m a sucker for a bad movie. If I can sit down and watch a bad film with terrible acting and a predictable plot, I’m usually a happy camper. That said, I do have standards. I need to be entertained. There is pulpy enjoyment level that can be achieved by an entertainingly bad film.   Somewhere between incomprehensible and mediocre, these very bad entertaining films lie.  Urban Legends  or  Deep Blue Sea  are films who take logic into their own hands and the world around them abides. It is the Michael Myers factor (the killer from the  Halloween  films). No matter how fast you run, Michael will be right behind you, if not in front of you, and it is that sort of relation to reality which I’m getting at.  That said,  Dead End  starring Ray Wise and Alexandra Holden, is not an entertaining bad film in any sense of the word. Oh, it is a bad film, but not an entertaining one. It falls into the category just beyond affectionately bad: Actually Bad.   I get ahead of myself. The film has a plot, a long and excruciating plot. It involves a family that is going to Christmas Eve dinner at Grandma’s house. They’re late, and while the family falls asleep in the car, the father decides to take a shortcut. Soon after, he falls asleep. He wakes up just in time to avoid a car accident. Suddenly, weird and mysterious things start to happen.  Ok, how is it bad? In creative writing courses the first rule is you never end with: and then he woke up.  Dead End  breaks that rule. The film doesn’t even have the decency to give its characters the deaths they deserve, or even show them die at all. Which screams of low budget filmmaking. Literally.  I have nothing against low budget filmmaking, The  Evil Dead  films are greater for their budgetary shortcomings. Sam Raimi and cohorts used this obstacle as a means of inspiration. But inspiration is foreign to this project.  All the deaths occur miraculously off screen, and when the family happens upon the dead relatives, there is never a shot of the remains, only reaction shots. While the use of the reaction shoot or cut aways from the violence works in many films (just watch the ear cutting scene in  Reservoir Dogs ) it does not work here.   Why? To start, the film never builds up the credibility to make the horror seem real. It never seems that anyone is in danger. There are times when the film builds a small sense of suspense but the audience is more relieved that “shocks” come at all.  There are other things that puzzle me about the plot:   By the end, the audience is suppose to believe that certain things have happened and others did not. This leaves the audience questioning everything about the plot, which in this case is not a very good thing. Things I wondered about: Were any of the family secrets actually revealed? Were these just the psychosis of main character? Who green lit this project?  Other bad choices:  Dead End  introduces a character, the Lady in White, and misuses her vengeance to the point of stupidity. Passing on the fact that she is one of the most ineffective villains in recent memory, the film never elaborates on why, when she had the chance, she did not kill everybody?  *Spoiler Alert* I am assuming that I will be the only person who saw this film or is going to see this film, so I really don’t have a problem ruining the end.   Everyone dies in a car accident, the same car accident that the film misleads you to believe they avoided. This is where the Lady in White comes from; she was a passenger in the other car who also dies. When this is “revealed”, it comes across as head slappingly stupid. What the film wants you to believe is that the Lady is killing these innocent people, when in fact she’s killing her murders.   It is not as if the concept is flawed, just the execution. By the time that this revelation occurs, the audience is far beyond caring.   Furthermore, the characters are attributed with personal histories that do not add up to anything. It’s as if the filmmakers pulled characteristics out of hat. Why is it that the pot smoking son has a better grasp of reality than the psychiatrist daughter? Is that a social comment? If so, why kill him and spare the daughter?  The filmmakers do not seem to understand the effects of drinking or smoking pot. In this film, smoking pot is similar to morphine, and drinking does not impair you ability to drive.   Dead End  is the type of film that you can hear the filmmakers talking about how the audience missed the hidden meaning. Maybe we did, but I do not think I want to have them explain it to me.  *Note* As I’ve already explain, I love bad films. So I knew what I was getting in for when I rented  Dead End , for it had no theatrical release in Ireland, though it was made in France, with American actors. Why would it have been made with American actors in France, you might ask? And it would be a good question. My thought is that Ray Wise, who starred in  Twin Peaks , is probably a sort of cult figure in the same way that David Lynch is in France.      \n",

Troy  (or, God Damn It!) 3.  The Day After Tomorrow  (or What Happened to Europe?)  Out of these three bad movies, only Roland Emmirch’s  The Day After Tomorrow  seems like somebody on board was willing to ask the important questions, such as: Why are we making this film? or Who really wants to give two and half hours of their life for this? or Maybe we should have Eric Bana act by himself and then we’ll enter a digital representation of Orlando Bloom in Post-Production?          I really disliked all of these films, but I’ll spare  The Day After Tomorrow  for now... expect to say, “What happened to Europe?” I mean, we get Japan and some English guys in the Atlantic not to mention the scene in New Deli where it’s snowing, but what about Europe? Apparently, they didn’t notice. Or were on their lunch breaks. (Having lived here now for a year, I can say that they do take long lunch breaks, so perhaps...) Maybe they just gave up? “Look,” they might have said if they have been given screen time, “a huge snow storm is coming. Shit. Well, I’m not moving until I’ve finished my tea!” Or something.  Oh, one more question: What about the weather in New Deli? At the Climatologists seminar in New Deli, it is snowing, yet only a reporter comments on this fact. I find it strange that a room full of weathermen don’t find it remarkable enough to mention this little gem. Not Dennis Quaid, not Ian Holm. It might have come in useful in that whole, the-climate-is-changing-and-we’re-all-gonna-die scenario they find themselves in later.  Anyway, back to more important crap:  Van Helsing . Please keep in mind that I’m a fan of both  The Mummy  and  The Mummy Returns , but not  Van Helsing . Stephan Sommers, the director of all three of these films, had a sort of absurd glee in  The Mummy  films. That glee has been lost here.   It has been replaced by a film that assembled all the waste of other bad movies, and made a pie. A crap pie. And who wants to eat crap pie?  There is one good thing about the film. The cinematography is very good. The matching of CGI and human action is, for the most part, very good. But the film makes the worst mistake in all action films that use CGI: an all-CGI final fight sequence! I’d rather have the bone crushing goodness of  Kill Bill vol. 1  than watch CGI critters smack each other in a fight scene that make the  WWE  seem realistic.   This doesn’t even begin to touch the problem with casting. What was Hugh Jackman thinking? Well, I know what he was thinking, but how did he believe that this film would actually help his career as an action hero. He was better in  Kate & Leopold . He’s good as Wolverine, but very, very bad as Van Helsing. He delivers his lines as if he’s acting in another dimension. I’m reminded of the  Mystery Science Theatre 3000  episode, in which the hero holds a befuddled look when held in close-up, to which the hecklers (the robots and Mike) scream “Help me, I’m stuck in another dimension.” I believe this same principal applies to Hugh Jackman in this movie.  He is so out of sync with the tone of the Sommer’s film that it becomes distracting. As for the tone, only one actor gets it right: Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. You may remember Roxburgh as the evil prince from  Moulin Rouge  or the Dougray Scott’s sidekick in  Mission Impossible II . He is a phenomenal character actor, in the fact that you could see him again and again and only kind of recognize him from the last part that you saw him in. Here he nails the ludicrous nature of the part, half over acting and half measured. Such a good performance is wasted in a film like this.  But such is the fate in a film as uneven as this. When action sequences are overshadowed by the acting of the villain, then you’re in trouble.   Speaking of being in trouble,  Troy  is full of so many errors, that it never seems to get on the right footing. From the very beginning, when Achilles is late for war, the film seems doomed to failure. (What!?! Achilles is late for war? The guy is full of rage and fury, two things, that if I’m not mistaken, don’t allow for peaceful sleep.)   The only item of praise could be Eric Bana as Hector, but even he is saddled by the ineffective Orlando Bloom. As Paris, Bloom shows no signs of waking from the slumber that has affected him since the  Lord of the Rings  trilogy ended. In fact, I would wager a guess that Bana would have had a better time acting without Bloom standing next to him. If Bloom had been added in post to the scene in which he was required, the other actors might have had a better time of it. (In this scenario, it would have been fun to place different sized Bloom’s all over the film. In scenes where his services weren’t even required, as a sort of game: Where’s Orlando? But that would have required a sort playfulness that these filmmakers entirely lack.)  The other faults are so numerous that it’s better just to make a list:  1. Brad Pitt as Achilles. Pitt is a fantastic modern actor, but that’s it: he’s a modern actor. He is too nuanced and subtle to play a man of rage. The part would have been better played by someone like Stellan Skarsgård or a young Nick Nolte, someone capable of broad strokes.  2. The CGI. I would rather watch a million crabs walk on a deserted beach than watch another mass of CGI warriors do battle in an “epic” film.  3. Julie Christie as Achilles mother. Wasn’t Achilles mother a God? Christie’s scene is so bizarre that omitting it would have been better, a theme I would have liked to introduce to the entire film. Anyway, everyone knows Achilles story, why do we need anybody to tell us that he’s doomed to immortality if he goes to war. Or if you don’t know it, for whatever reason, why have it ruined by such a crappy scene?  4. Where are the Gods? I mean, come on. If you’re gonna spend this much time on developing the story of Achilles and the Greeks, why aren’t the Gods introduced as an important part of life?  5. Why is everyone white? Troy is located in the Middle East, and yet it’s populated by Western Europeans. Are we so short on African-American or Arabic-American actors that we have to populate the film with white guys with dark hair? Come on, you could throw the Wayan’s family a bone. This question of course opens a bigger question, which I don’t wish to address here.  Troy is over two hours long, and now I’ve wasted a page of clean paper on discussing it. That’s quite enough.        \n",

      "       *A reminder. The  Sarcastic Kitten  system of film reviews is the reverse of most starring systems. The less you get, the better you did. Films are graded zero to four.*   Films Reviewed    Japanese Story     (1 SK)    Mean Girls   (1/2 SK)     The summer so far... has been a disappointment. There haven’t been any exuberant or awe-inspiring spectacles that have littered the cinemas to this point, instead we’ve been ‘entertained’ by the less than original melodrama’s of  Troy ,  Van Helsing  and  The Day after Tomorrow . (As of now, I’ve yet to see  Shrek 2  or  Spiderman 2  because they have not arrived on this side of the Atlantic.)   This is not to say that I’ve bided my time on less than worth-it films. On the contrary, I’ve seen good films but not the kind of popcorn fare that one wishes to find in the summertime.    Japanese Story , a film from New Zealand starring Toni Collete, was a good surprise. It’s ending lacked the punch that the film deserved, but Collete and her costars brought depth to their characters and believability to the situations.   June also saw the release of  Mean Girls . Out of all the films I’ve seen this summer,  Mean Girls  is by far the best. It sounds kind of dumb, I know, but  Mean Girls  powered by the very talented Lindsey Lohan, is very good.   It suffers from the same lack the  Japanese Story  does, neither seem to know the best way to end the film. Not a problem they share alone. It is probably the hardest thing to do: end the story right. Becoming so invested in the characters and the film, sometimes the writers/directors/stars fail to see the best way out.   SPOILER ALERT! *I promise that the following comments on the ends of these films will not destroy the enjoyment of seeing them.*    Japanese Story  overstays its welcome. It becomes too heartfelt and loses its objectivity. The film, until the end, keeps its distance, so that the audience can judge the characters for themselves. In the conclusion, it tells the audience how to feel about them. By that time the audience already knows. It comes across as if the director didn’t believe that the audience could fully commit to the emotion that they(the director) felt it deserved, so they employed the over used technique of musical manipulation to help to underscore their points. A technique that in lesser films fills the audience with pseudo-emotional ties, but in this film comes across like the director doesn’t trust the audience with the information that they’ve been given.   This is not to say that objectivity is better than the subjectivity, manipulation has always been the Cinema’s primary job. It simply would have been a better film if it had stuck to one theme.   Sticking to its theme would have helped  Mean Girls  as well. It starts off as a commentary on social structure of High School, and it is in good hands until the last act, when moralizing gets the upper hand. I understand why it moralizes. It is a film for teenagers and Lohan’s primary audience is in fact seventeen-year-olds. My problem is that I’m 26, and looking for the level beyond. That is my problem, not the film’s (a fact that I’ll reiterate until I’m dead, if that’s what it takes to get my point across). It’s not  Heathers , but it is  Bring it On . I believe that if the film had ended differently, that it might not be as good a film.           I know that’s contradictory.           I think the filmmakers (Mark Waters, director and Tina Fey, writer) knew exactly what they were doing and that what they wanted came out in the final product, but it still left a bitter taste in my mouth. Specifically, Waters and Fey want a film that is marketable to teenagers. While they’ll happily take adults money, they aren’t interested in opening up a discussion about High School. The easiest way to do this is end the film happily; no moral ambiguity. This is where it becomes contradictory. I think the film is right in doing this, it is not af is the filmmakers were striving to make another  Elephant . As in Water’s previous film,  Freaky Friday , he’s made good entertainment for parents and children. Unlike  Freaky Friday ,  Mean Girls  does not allow for conversation once the audience walks out of the theatre.         \n",

Here are the rules:  Each film may receive zero to four Sarcastic Kittens. Consider this the opposite of how most reviewers rate films. If a movie receives no SKs, then it was good. Very good.

      "         Intimate Strangers (Confidences trop intimes ) (Zero SK)    It is really hard to classify a Patrice Leconte film properly. They dwell in the gray area between bad French films and wondrous character studies.    It is not accurate to say that his films are an acquired taste; the taste is already there if you like to go to the cinema. It is more accurate to say that you will like them if you let yourself. Leconte’s films are films that wander into the stories and take their time once there. Mostly, his films will not accept an outside agenda.   What this all breaks down to is that his films are complete, confident works. They are crafted and completed exactly the way that he wanted them.    Intimate Strangers  is a great example of this. The film works like all of Leconte’s films: characters meet, find that they have something in common, and try to examine what it would be like if their life was a little different.   Very little happens in the way of convetional storytelling, there are no reversals or recognitions. Everything is more or less, as it seems. Still, the story and objectives of the characters are clear, without being straight forward. Leconte deftly uses the MacGuffin, a concept that Hitchcock used, in which the main action of the piece is skewed by an item of importance that all the characters would kill for.   Where in Hitchcock the MacGuffin would be classified information or a missing package, for Leconte, the MacGuffin is the intentions that the characters bring in the room.   In  Intimate Strangers , Anna (Sandrine Bonnaire) wanders into what she believes is her psychiatrist’s office and sits down Monsieur Faber (Fabrice Luchini) to tell him her problems. He is not her psychiatrist, but a tax lawyer.   This, eventually, comes to light, and still Anna visits Faber. Why she continues to visit the lawyer, tell him her problems, and disturb his work life, are what the main structure of the film hangs on and the MacGuffin.   These scenes, between Luchini and Bonnaire, are wondrous. Leconte and his cinematographer Eduardo Serra, let the camera hang on the characters, drifting around necklines and mouths like a kiss dreaming of a home.   In the office, the film is made. Without effort, these scenes play and develop.    Finally,  Intimate Strangers  boasts one of the most vibrant scenes in recent memory. Monsieur Faber dances exuberantly to a record of Wilson Pickett’s “In the Midnight Hour”. This sequence lasts only a few moments, but is as close to ‘truly cinematic’ as anything I’ve seen. Pure emotion, expressed by someone that you’d never expect to express it in the way that they do. The scene is the mixture of surprise and expectation. Luchini brings an energy and enjoyment rarely seen in the movies.   What the rest of the film is about and what happens is best discovered by the audience; writing about it makes the joy it brings too mundane.  Intimate Strangers  is very good. It is a film that is at once complicated and incredibly simple.         \n",

      "         Ju-On (The Grudge ) (1 SK)    This is the type of film that will drive rational people out of their minds. Why? In the world of the film, apparently the most effective way to hide is to pull your bed covers over your head. When I was five that worked, well, that and my Mom sitting on the bed next to me, but as an adult I have grown past that phase and have moved on to finding some sort of weapon.  Characters in horror films are not that evolved. They still wander into stupid locations and announce their presence by some ridiculous method, but that is why audiences go to see them. People want to see them die. And they want to get scared.   Great horror films use intelligent people in situations that work when rationale will not. Think of  The Exorcist . What rational person could deal with that situation? Most horror films fall into the category just below this one, where not-so-smart characters find themselves in situations they could easily dislodge themselves from by running or going on vacation.   (If Laurie Strode had just bought a plane ticket and moved to Europe, Michael Myers would have had a hell of a time finding her. It is not like the security would have let him through customs. Imagine that interaction:   Passport Agent : Ok, Mr. Myers. What’s the purpose of your visit?  Michael Myers : (kicks ground with foot) Kill Laurie Strode.  Passport Agent : Guards!  Maybe include some banter about how he looks like a bleached William Shatner mask... Of course, all of these situations would end up with Michael killing people and eventually being deported, but Ms. Strode would be fine.)  The point of this meaningless diatribe is that the situations these characters find themselves in are as irrelevant as the conversations about what they should have done.    Ju-On  is a film on the verge of being very good, but it falls short in the third act. Instead of everything coming together, the answer seems either idiotic or incomprehensible, depending on your mood, but one way or another the audience leaves scratching their head trying to figure out what happened to the film they had been watching.  The film is a variation of the new wave of horror coming out of Japan, films like Hideo Nakata’s  Ring  or the work of Takashi Miike ( Audition ).  Ju-On  steals from  Ring  in the same way Quentin Tarantino steals from everyone, right out there in the open so you can call them on it. Though, it is important to point out that they both steal for the improvement of their own films.   In  Ju-On , there is a sequence where a character looks through a security monitor and sees a ghostly shape moving towards the camera. For everyone who has seen Ring or the American remake, this scene might ring a bell. But the end to this scene in Ju-On is different enough to be original and more importantly, creepy.  The story involves a curse, or grudge, that a dead family places on a house. Anyone who become associated with the house either dies or becomes part of the curse. It is a sort of “tag, you’re it” style of storytelling. The film jumps from story to story, through time and back again, to come to its conclusion. It is not a precise method, but it does not hamper the film in the obvious ways, that is to say, there are still some very good moments of terror, such as the lady who crawls and the boy in white face are both creepy. (Despite, or maybe because of, the bad make-up.)  As a horror film, it works well enough. If you let it tell its story, it will scare you. Or it will scare you long enough to see its American remake, which hits theaters this fall, directed by Takashi Shimizu, who did this version as well, and starring Sarah Michelle Gellar.       \n",

      "         Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  (1/2 SK)    The third installment of the Harry Potter series is arguably the best of the three, while simultaneously being the most incomplete. To be sure, the acting and cinematic craft of the film has reached a new high, but the story has suffered. It is the classic damned if you do, damned if you don’t situation.  My view of the film has been tainted by the fact that I have read the books and know what has been omitted. I know and accept this flaw in my reasoning, but I also contest that the film still fails in certain other tangible places.  The best example is Gary Oldman as the madman Sirius Black. Why is his arrival in the film so belated? He is such an interesting character, a character that screams for more screen time than he is given. While always in the shadows, the director never makes Oldman’s presence felt.   The film is misleading in this manner. It is not really about the Prisoner of Azkaban, but the adolescence of Potter and his friends. Which is fine, it just does not fully represent the intentions of the plot.   The slight of hand would be more successful if in fact Sirius Black surprised the audience with his appearance, instead of just materializing when and where he is suspected.  This is not to say that the film is bad. By all means, it is a good film and all of the surrounding puzzle pieces fit in seamlessly. It is easy to criticize a film for what it does not have. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban might have been better with a talking giraffe, but it does not have one and that is an unfair criticism. In the same way, the series has created such rich characters that the reduction of screen time might also be seen as a negative.   Alfonso Cuarón and his crew have done a wonderful job adapting a novel into a moving picture. Cuarón has crafted some wonderful performances out of the Daniel Radcliff and Emma Watson. (I would include Rupert Grint, but he has been good in all three.) Wonderful British actors like David Thewlis and Timothy Spall have rounded out the cast of characters nicely, but all of this does not solve the Oldman problem.  Why does it seem that Oldman is the ood man out? Most likely, it is because his character rests inside the largest of the plot holes. In the book, Professor Lupin(Thewlis) has been helping Black in his return to Hogwarts. Lupin has helped Black search the campus for his betrayer.   But in the movie there is no explanation for Black’s apparent ease in avoiding capture, or how he gets in and out of the castle. It is not that the book’s way of dealing with this problem is the best, but that it deals with it at all. It is easy to concede to a film’s logic when it is present, but hard when the audience has to figure it out themselves.  For goodness sake, the film title specifies what the film is about. How can there be any confusion on the “how’s” and the “why’s” of Sirius Black’s relation to the world that he embodies?  Maybe the fourth film will answer the questions that the third raises, but it that fair? The audience for these films is built in, so whether or not these questions are answered will become futile.        \n",

      "   Well I guess it's official, the ex gave our son until 09/15 to remove himself from the premises.  Actually he told him to either shape up or ship out and my son has elected to ship out.  So, he's 18, fresh out of high school, his only transportation is a bike, he has $1,000 in the bank and is looking to strike out on his own.  We are trying to get him to move up here but he doesn't want to leave his friends.  I don't have the heart to tell him that he won't have the same friends in another few years.  But he's 18 and the world is beckoning and there are lessons to be learned that only he can learn on his own.  My car is fixed, it's running great and I am so very happy to be able to drive myself to and from work everyday.  Not that I minded Grey dropping me off and picking me up but my time to and from work is a time of transition to either gear up for work or to wind down and I prefer to do that alone where I can control the music, the temperature of the a/c and what lane of traffic I'm in. LOL  I think that this is the very first time that I have not watched the Olympics at all!  I used to eagerly anticipate it but for some reason it doesn't hold any interest for me this year, not even the equestrian events.  Grey and I are still in our CSI kick and are currently watching the 2nd season.  Oh, I had choir practice last night for the first time.  Definitely some tough stuff to learn.  I think I will get better as time goes on.  It's not that I can't sing, it's reading the music, understanding the different symbols and words.  I was taught that stuff as a child taking piano lessons but that was over 30 years ago and I have forgotten most of it.  I need to remember what means to go faster, to go slower, to pause, to increase in volume, to be soft, etc.  I also need to remember which bar the sopranos sing or I'm going to end up accidentally being a soloist! LOL  That's it for me for today, actually a very peaceful, boring day.  Just waiting to see how long it takes for Al Safr to become a martyr.   \n",

      "   Okay I know, one post and then nothing! LOL  What can I say, I get distracted!  Grey and I are getting along much better since my first post.  Nice thing about us, we may have a disagreement, but it doesn't take long before we are back to normal and being madly in love again.  Not that we ever stopped loving each other when we were arguing    I passed my CTP exam!  I didn't realize just how much stress I was under and how much pressure was on me until it was over and I felt like I was walking on air!  Now that's it's over, I look back and think 'What was the big deal, now I have letters to put after my name'  But I know that if I hadn't have passed it, I would have felt horrible.  Bonnie and Charley came and went without much consequence here.  Some rainy weather, some tornados, but nothing that was any more than what we normally get during the summer.  We were mostly concerned about friends and family in Polk County which got slammed pretty hard.  Fortunately, most of the people we have down there live on the west side of the county, the east side of the county is still trying to clean up and Jeb Bush was out there yesterday to survey the damage.  I have a few friends who are still without power and are struggling to get chainsaws to cut up trees that fell on their property but fortunately no one was injured.  My best friend and I are having some problems regarding trust issues and my 'interference' in her relationship with Grey.  My suggestion for anyone contemplating any kind of poly relationship?  Don't! LOL   Raven and I aren't intimate and Grey and her aren't intimate either anymore however her children regard him as their Dad and she still regards him as her Dominant.  Add me, best friend and also Dominant but not her Dominant but married to her Domminant and you get conflict LOL.  She wrote me a nice long letter yesterday outlining all of her issues.  It is going to take me a couple of days to think through the things she said and respond in a rational manner.  Tonight is my first night of official choir practice.  I guess we will be preparing for a concert that we have coming up next month and I'm sure we will soon be preparing for the Christmas programs.   I have had two bad dreams about my daughter Morgan the past week.  The first one, Grey woke me up because I was yelling and crying in my sleep.  In that one, someone came along on a motorcycle or motorscooter or something and abducted her.  Last night, she had been out playing and never came home.  I dreamt one long dream last night which I spent looking for her with a police officer.  I even woke up during the night and tried to change my thoughts so I wouldn't dream it anymore, but I kept dreaming.  Grey says that I'm having separation anxiety after having her all summer long which makes sense.  I just wish they would stop.  Just got off the phone with the ex.  He's about to kick my son out of the house because of his mouth and his attitude.   If he does, he will likely have to move up here with his mouth and his attitude and something is going to have to change.  We aren't anymore inclined to put up with it than his Dad and Renee are.  How do you get an 18 year old with a chip on his shoulder to change his attitude?  Not going to be doing much in the way of lifestyle stuff for the next couple of months.  Gator games are taking priority on Saturdays although we already have a conflict on labor day weekend as I was planning to take Grey to the season opener but he had promised Raven and the kids that they could come up that weekend.  Yet another family squabble to work out.    I need to find a slave that changes cat litter and likes to go to football games.  LOL  Wait, that's right, they don't have to like football, they just go with and keep running for cokes and pizza while I enjoy the game!  It's good to be the king. LOL  From what I understand Don and Michelle are going to Bermuda in September and won't be at Chambers anyway so not a big loss to miss that one anyway.  October is another story however, with David and Gem coming down from NYC, Lord Blakwolf and Tig's collaring at The Ranch, the Biketoberfest weekend at the ranch and a Cecil and Becca's wedding/collaring that same weekend.   October is definitely going to be party time.  Oh and let's not forget Florida/Georgia October 30, another kind of party  : )   At some point between now and then Grey will be having his surgery.  So the next couple of months promise to be very busy and then we get into the holiday season.  It will be 2005 before we know it!  Well I guess I should probably get back to work! LOL  It's nice to have a slow day every now and then.     \n",

      "       Every morning I take the same road to work. First, let me tell you that I grew up in a rural area - the Catskills in NY - and I do NOT like big cities, except, perhaps, to visit. I also love animals and birds. My husband and I are avid birders.  Anyway, now I live in a city. (My ex-husband moved me here.....nuff said) A city that used to be rural many years ago, and still has a few 'country' looking areas left. What do I do? Try to find them in my living and driving areas, and make sure I choose THOSE routes rather than heavily travelled thouroughfares.  So.....every day I take the same road to work - it's a little connecting 'back' road kind of thing, in an area that used to be all farms and horses and many acre homesteads. There are still some left, but they are disappearing rapidly.  On this little 2-mile-long road things are changing. There used to be a ranch style single story home raised up onto the second story (a building technique used in places that flood a lot, like in the Keys). It was on several acres of brushy land, full of palm and other types of trees. There were always two barking hound dogs that chased along the front fence, and there were Egyptian geese that perched on the roof of the house, along with other assorted ducks - even some peacocks. The front of the house boasted a front porch with chairs to sit and watch life go by, and couple of semi-beat up pick ups parked on the grass to the side. It was lovely. It had been there for at least 40 years - that's my guess. All kinds of birds and wild parrots frequented the trees there.  One morning a couple of weeks ago, I saw the bulldozers. The dogs and the pickups were gone. A sign had been planted out by the road 'Coming Soon!! Distinctive Estate Homes!!'  Crap. Another piece of the old, gentler times gone. I bet the problem was that the original owner didn't make much money, and couldn't make necessary improvements to the old house. But, since land prices here are going sky high - your house can be worth $10,000. more at the end of any given month - he was sitting on a gold mine - the ability to retire and live in a nice new house somewhere else. So he sold to the Evil AntiChrist Developers, tucked tail and ran. His neighbors across the street, still living on the same types of property and in older homes, are fingering their thin wallets, perhaps. Thinking, 'gotta get outta here'.  And so my little rural road, my little 2 mile long piece of 'country' is rapidly diminishing, falling to the developers and their dull, cookie cutter, blow-down-at-the-first-big-wind, $500,000. homes - and the idiots that buy them and, unfortunately, inhabit them.  And with the new owners, come the new ideals. No trees, except palms. Lawns must be manicured and bushes well trained and trimmed. No room for birds or wildlife to hide.  And you know what is the saddest thing? The black capped parakeets and the pair of Pileated woodpeckers that I know lived there in the past, depending on the dead palm trunks for home and nest - they'll move too. To be replaced by the usual grackles and pidgeons.  I need to move to Montana, except I'm scared of the snow.      \n",

      "       This past weekend, my husband and I went 'urban exploring'. If you google this phrase, you'll get tons of links to ..... you guessed it.....urban explorers - people, mostly young and spry, who investigate (read 'trespass' or 'break in') abandoned buildings in any given city on the planet. These are people after my own heart. I am a frustrated archeologist and explorer. I can think of nothing more fascinating than sneaking into an abandoned building and seeing what can be found.  We went to a site in the Everglades, off the Ingraham Highway (#9336) and turned off on a road called 'Aerojet'. On the left side is the nifty 'Everglades Youth Camp' - actually a juvenile prison surrounded by high barbed wire fencing. As you proceed about a 1/2 mile down the paved road, there are lots of trees on the right, and on the left about 300 feet off the road, are abandoned concrete buildings, some of which are 2 stories high. There are lots of buildings spread out over acres, and the road that leads off to the left, towards them, is blocked. There are 'no trespassing' signs EVERYWHERE, and of course, a piece of fencing is down (torn down) and easy access to the whole place is before us.  We did not go in.  We are not young.  We do not have a gun.  There was an empty white pickup parked where we stopped and no human(s) to be seen.  We do not want to go to jail. So we didn't go in. But we WANTED to REALLY REALLY REALLY bad. If we could just get a bunch of people to go with us, we would feel safer - except we would certainly be noticeable then......  We're going back.  Until we have the chutzpah to trespass.  When we got home, we did mucho internet research and found out that Aerojet Corp purchased some 35 acres at that spot in the 60's.....they experimented with solid rocket boosters, with the idea of shipping them via water to Cape Canaveral for the Space Race. In fact, a whole canal was created that runs all the way to the Bay and under Card Sound Road. When you are on Card Sound Road (I read this, but have not seen for myself), you come to this canal, there is a bridge that opens up - and the question arises, 'why is there a bridge like this on a small canal?' The answer is the Saturn V rockets that would have floated underneath, on their way to Aeroject in the Everglades.  The location never did well, they ran a few tests, never hired the employees they thought they would - and it all went down the drain.......Aerojet, who purchased the land for about $50.00 an acre, sold to the South Florida Water Mgmt. District for about $1.78 million - and the SFWMD is turning the area into a 'buffer' area between Homestead/Redlands agricultural runoff and the Everglades National Park, directly to the south of the Aeroject site. It is already a place for hunters during the season, and is listed alternately as 'Frog Pond' or 'Lucky Hammock'. Birders go there in the winter and many migratory species are reported there.  Well - that is our research....and there those buildings stand 'to this very day.' The End     \n",

      "              And Don't Forget to Feel Good About Yourself.   David Brooks takes another swing at hyper-competitive students, what he calls 'project kids,' in an   Op-Ed  in yesterday's Times.  The overall message of the piece is a good one: that high school students shouldn't be obsessed with getting into the 'top' college, or be overly burdened by the test scores, grades, and extracurricular activities that are prerequisite at a lot of these places.  But in making this plea, Brooks writes a lot of things are misleading or simply not true, and the average reader who take his advice to heart and actually act on it are setting themselves up for disappointment and failure.   First, Brooks, as only he can, makes generalizations like '[y]ou are being judged according to criteria that you would never use to judge another person and which will never again be applied to you once you leave higher ed.' This would be true, if you plan to being a subsistence fisherman in Bermuda or a porn star after graduation. For the rest of us, each step in our professional lives after college will involve being judged and (someday, hopefully) judging others along similar criteria. Sure, no one will care whether you were an officer in your school government; instead you will be asked equally meaningless and even more determinitive questions about your 'leadership' experience at your last job.   Second, Brooks makes the outrageous claim that measures like tests scores and GPA will never again be relevant in your life. That's not even true in the narrowest and most trivial sense of the statement, because you will be evaulated by your LSAT, or MCAT, or (at least partly) GRE scores. Not to mention your undergraduate GPA, not to mention your performance evaluations at work, given out by bosses who are, as hard as it may be to believe, a whole lot worse at objective evaluation than your teachers. It is this kind of sovereign disregard for reality that leads to statements like: 'Once you reach adulthood, the key to success will not be demonstrating teach-pleasing competence across fields.' Right, the key will be demonstrating boss-pleasing competence across competely arbitrary fields (e.g. 'is this guy a team-player,' or 'goal-oriented,' whatever those mean).  The last two problems are due to a sanguine view of the adult world, perhaps understandably so from someone as professionally successful and as well educated as Brooks himself. More troubling, however, is Brooks' characterization of liberal arts education.  Brooks writes that it's a travesty that high school students are forced to read things 'that are intrinsically boring to [them],' and that the entire system of general education causes students to 'stop thinking about which subjects are boring and which exciting,' such that 'each class [becomes] a hoop you must jump through on your way to a first-class university. You learn[] to thrive in adult-supervised settings.' The result of this process for these over-achieving students, Brooks believes, is that they will be 'whittle[d]...down into a bland, complaisant achievement machine.'   I gather his preferred alternative is that we all become either creative, passionate geniuses or ignorant, incurious slobs (or fishermen or porn stars). Because the purpose of a liberal arts education is to give students the exposure to subjects they may not have considered 'intrinsically interesting' simply because they'd never had sufficient knowledge of them.   There is certainly a subset of the high school population out there which should take this advice to heart. But I suspect that those students who are completely sure of what they want to do, and already possess the skills, discipline, and tenacity to achieve their self-discovered goals have enough of a clue not to get derailed by the competitive college-admissions environment in the first place.  But most students, including this one, were largely clueless about most things in high school and for most of college (if not afterwards as well). For us, I think the 'achievement machine' is a hedge against the formation of or changes to future goals, precisely because it is undifferentiated in the skills it imparts on those willing to learn, and precisely because it gives us the generic credentials (GPA, LSAT, empty extracurriculars) that will be needed in the place of genuine passion that simpy may not be there. It would be wonderful if finding careers were like finding love, an experience that hits us suddenly so that we know we've found 'the one.' But I also suspect that most people don't really care that deeply about   any  career, and couldn't give a monkey as long and what he ends up doing satisfies a few basic criteria (pays enough to live on, at least occassionally interesting, etc.). For those us, it is perhaps best to stack up our credentials, because when two (and there will certainly be more) equally disinterested people apply for the same job, guess who has a better shot of getting it?  It's great to send optimistic messages like 'the [admissions] letters you get over the next few weeks don't determine anything.' But before we decide that our glass is half-full, we better make sure we have a glass, and a way to get some liquid into it.           \n",

      "              Readings on Terror  of the law firm variety.   I came across this   site  , while reading   And What Thanks Do We Get , which is a weblog that (we think) is written by a couple of partners are a smallish sounding firm.   But the anonymous writer of the first blog claims to be a hiring partner at a 'large firm in a major city,' and sounds pretty credible, not that I can really tell. It could be a total sham, just some associate or law student making a joke, but the whole thing does sound oddly sincere at points.  In any event, some of the posts are really funny, but mostly the site is pretty sobering - about the long hours and client demands, and this guy is a partner! But the hiring story in the very first entry is worth citing in length:  My favorite interviewing story is the time I made the law student totally break down. He was a law review kid, from either Columbia or NYU, I think. He asked me what my favorite thing about the firm was. I told him it was the way everyone was so nice to me after my nervous breakdown.   'I explained that I'd been in the office for a week straight, doing due diligence on a really important case, as a first-year associate, and the partner I was working for came in and just started screaming at me, throwing things, telling me he was going to throw me right through the window if I didn't get my act together and start earning my salary. So I started crying, and he took the picture frame from my desk, and slammed it into the ground, and glass went everywhere, and I just lost it, and had to be sent away to the hospital to recover for a few days. But when I got back, I explained, everyone was really nice about it. They only made me work 6 days that week, and even let me grab a quick lunch that Friday.   'So I could tell this kid didn't want to believe anything I was saying, but I kept a straight face through it all. And he asked if I was telling the truth, and I told him I could show him the picture frame to prove it -- that I had the broken picture frame in my drawer, all this time. And I reached for the drawer, to open it, and he quickly said of course he believed me, and wanted to know if things were really that bad.   'I was the last interview before he went out to lunch with two associates, and when they filed their reports they said he was a mess, couldn't stop shaking and fidgeting, asked all these lifestyle questions, and went to the bathroom right after the main course, and they thought he might have vomited it all up. This is power. Making law students vomit. This is why I like being a lawyer.  There are a few other posts that end with comments like 'and that's why I like being a lawyer,' including one about how he could have made some paralegal copy a stack of papers just because.  This reminds me, I should get an early start at Career Services looking for DOJ jobs.          \n",

      "              'Covering My Life'   I was, and still am, in the middle of eating the worst tuna sandwich I've ever had, when I received an e-mail asking about the URL of my blog. I excitedly wrote back only to find out that the soliciter was really only interested in a friend's blog that's linked on my page - try to guess which, it's not hard.  I indignantly wrote back, and the offender responded that my blog doesn't cover the events of my life. So I thought about posting about how bad my tuna fish sandwich is, but that might be interpreted as too 'theoretical.'  Other goings-on: I'm flying down to Atlanta Wednesday for the remainder of the week, and will also be there for next week. I get to stay at the swanky W Hotel for most of the time this trip, which should be really neat, even though Lauren said that the place is a little JAPy.   This scheduling change does mean that I'll have to miss the law school reception on Wednesday, which is definitely a shame. I'd really wanted to meet Dean Kagan, if just so I can tell her that her little brother was my favorite teacher in high school. What a small world. Also, there are suppose to be a bunch of young alumni at the event, at least some of whom are probably junior associates (those that can escape for a part of an evening) and it would have been pretty useful to ask them about career stuff.   In baseball news: I dropped LeCroy for Mauer in one of my leagues, which may or may not have been a good move. On the one hand there is all this hype about Mauer and he will be the starting catcher. One the other hand, it takes Yahoo! forever to update players' positions (Chipper Jones was at third base all of last year), and LeCroy will be the DH, so he'll still be putting up decent numbers in my catcher's position.   I'm also trying to compile some semblance of a reading list for the month of May. Columbia's PhD program in political theory has a pretty useful reading list, and I think I'll start with the following:  Tocqueville's   Democracy in America , because it always sounds insightful when people refer to it, and I've never read it.  Freud's   Civilization and Its Discontens . I have no idea what this is about, but I like reading about discontent; and I guess Civilization is... pretty cool too?  Plato's   Gorgias , because it has a funny title.  Now, I have to talk about this tuna sandwich. It's called a 'spa' sandwich and it's suppose to be healthy, so they use carrots instead of celery and nothing instead of mayo. And it tastes just awful. Don't ever buy it. Ok, I'm done. Hopefully something more substantive and 'theoretical' later today.          \n",

      "              Fantasy Baseball  I did another fantasy baseball draft this Friday, and I thought I drafted a pretty good team, but they it looks really weak based on last year's stats. I think it's because the majority of my guys had years cut short by injury, or are still on their way up as players. So hopefully they will outperform their stats this year.  Anyway, here's my team: C:   LeCroy 1B: Sweeney 2B: Castillo 3B: Lowell SS: Jeter OF: Guerrero OF: Abreu OF: Pierre Util: Baldelli BN: Dunn BN: Ensberg BN: Kearns  SP: Millwood SP: Pedro SP: Brandon Webb SP: Harden SP: Penny SP: Myers CL: Rhodes CL: Percival CL: MacDougal  So, I think I should have the steals market cornered with Castillo, Pierre, Abreu, Baldelli, and Jeter. Hopefully Baldelli will hit for more power this year. And Dunn and Keanrs could give me great years too. We'll see. Another thing, Joe Mauer is still undrafted in my league, as is Shawn Chacon I think. I'd think about picking them up, but don't know who to drop on my team.  Thoughts?          \n",

      "              Before This Blog Gets Outsourced  Thought I'd post something not about the law for a change: a pretty well-argued essay,   The Outsourcing Bogeyman  by Daniel W. Drezner in Foreign Affairs, on why the flow of white-collar jobs from the U.S. to countries like India is not a bad thing.   One major complaint these days about outsourcing is that too many American jobs are being lost o overseas labor. The loss of white-collar jobs like computer programming and data analysis this time mirrors the loss of manufacturing jobs that started in the 1980s and accelorated in te 1990s. Drezner offers two responses to critics of outsourcing and proponents of protectionism. First, he argues that the claims of the number of jobs lost are often exaggerated for a variety of reasons, such as the fact that the baseline numbers used are often inflated 2000 bubble-economy numbers, or that the rate of outsourcing now is as much due to a management fad as to the long-term strategies of companies. So, the result in the near future is that the gross job loss will not be as high as people predict now.  The second argument is that the  net  loss of jobs will actually be negative, meaning that the flow of certain jobs abroad will lead to more and higher-paying jobs created at home. Drezner uses as his support for this argument both historical evidence and economic dogma. He observes that we are currently undergoing a structural shift in the economy, so that job growth will naturally lag a bit, just as it did during the last such shift in the early 1990s. The result of that shift was the rise of the information economy of which the United States was the undisputed leader. [On a side note,  I just recently read somewhere the use of the term silicon capitalism, which is I gather a variant of or a successor to finance capitalism.] Thus, the current 'jobless recovery' is a natural growing pain that accompanies such shifts.   Overall I'm inclined to buy his argument up to this point. I do see a few problems though. First, Drezner, like just about every other free trade advocate I've heard or read, is very vague about exactly the kind of jobs that will replace the jobs lost to overseas labor. He asserts that they will be more numberous, higher-paying, and require more sophisticated skills and training. But what kinds of jobs these might be is unclear. His only concrete examples are jobs that require geographic proximity, like sales and marketing, and the kind of jobs that are likely not be outsources at all, like 'retail and restaurants...and personal care.' It's hard to believe that any of these jobs are the high-paying, high added-value jobs that Drezner prophesied.  The other problem is not so much a shortcoming in Drezner argument as it is a problem (as I see it, with my near-nonexistent knowledge of the subject) with economic theory. Drezner claims that under ideal conditions, countries would behave much like individual firms do, and produce only those things at which they have a competitive advantage. This way, the economy operates at its most efficient level, and the total wealth of the world is at its peak. But the current trend of job creation and destruction in the United States suggests that, if this continues, the U.S.'s competitive advantage will be in the following areas: Executive Management, Advance Technology, Burger-flipping, and Bed pan-emptying. Now it's great that Americans will have a ton of jobs available to them in the first two industries, but it's really terrible for the people in this country who can't and don't want to jobs in those industries, because then, short of moving abroad, they're left with only the McJobs.   Specialization by firms work for people at large because if I'm bad at or despise one kind of work, I can go to another firm and find a new career. Most people switch careers in their lives at least once. Very few people switch countries. But if the trend towards country-specialization continues, the reasoning seems to me, switching careers may entail switching countries, and that is neither possible nor desirable for the vast majority of people.   Lastly, while Drezner's arguments are designed to counter the claims of people who oppose outsourcing for fear of domestic job loss, it completely ignores the other half of the interest group against the globalization of jobs, namely those who are concerned about the labor enviroment in the countries to which U.S. jobs are moving. It is no wonder why so many companies are outsourcing their jobs abroad - cheap labor. And while there exists economic reasons too complicated for me to understand that explain  why  workers in other country earn three pennies to the dollar of U.S. workers, there is also the simple reason that there are often fewer if any regulations in these other countries, allowing companies to exploit workers to a degree they could not possibly do (at least not all the time) in the U.S.  This last concern could just be economic naivete; it is arguable that the kind of governmental regulations and maket conditions cannot arise without there first being an impetus in the form of mass exploitation. Job growth and exploitation may be a necessary factor in the development of a strong labor market and worker-friendly laws, but surely it is not a sufficient factor. Without a hospitable political environment, there will unlikely ever be the kinds of regulations upon companies that will make the lives of workers significantly better in the long run. Also, governments that are not responsive to the needs of the people are strengthened by the growth of local and multinational elites at the expense of the rest of the population, since a strong middle-class is what authoritarian governments fear most. Job growth alone will not spur the political change that is also necessary for better jobs and living conditions. To think that would be political naivete.          \n",

      "              Stalin, Mao, Honecker & Pol Pot LLP?  I came across this '  Report of the Task Force on Lawyers' Quality of Life ' by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, a fine organzation where I did my 'community service' hours in high school - nothing spells community like a bunch of New York lawyers.   As expected, the report was at once vacuous and difficult to read. It dispenses advise ranging from the merely usesless, like '[t]he Task Force recommends that firms endevour to create an environment that recognizes that junior associates lack knowledge in substantive practial areas and are enetitled to seek appropriate guidance while assuming appropriate levels of responsibility,' while also chewing appropriate sticks of gum and blowing appropriate sized bubbles - while walking - should those activities conform to the firm's core values, to the suicidal, to the useless and trivial, like analyzing the optimal proportion of paralegals/associates/partners assigned to each secretary.   When I started reading the report I guess I was expecting to actually learn something useful, and in fact I did. I noticed that there seem to be a lot of commonalities between the language of law firms and the language of Communists. What do I mean by this?  For starters there is the propensity to form committees for everything: Executive committees, compensation committees, diversity committees, ethics committees, finance committees, library committees, space allocation committees, sexual harassment committees, morale committees (because nothing improves morale more than the recommendations of a committees, except maybe serving on such a committee) and so on and so on. Compare these committees to ye olde committees on iron ore production and on newspaper propaganda, and of course, to the Politburo, and the Standing Members thereof (which I guess would be the same thing as the Managing Partners...).   Then there is the idea of 'lock-step compensation' - paying classes of associates the same salary without regard to job performance - as a disincentive to work hard. Sounds familiar? One of the arguments against the command economy is that without market forces adjusting wages, workers and managers would have no incentive to do more since they get paid the same salary whether they produce the same minimum or three times the minimum.  Also, 64% of large New York firms included in the survey had associates' committees, which I guess is kind of the like firm equivalent of the Communist Youth Leagues, the training group for future apparachiks.   Finally, like communists states, firms are ruled largely by the personalities of a few Great Men; and at this point I think the analogy breaks down, but I still rather like it, so I'll go on for a bit longer. I'd imagine that the 'About Us' page on the web site of Stalin, Mao, Honecker & Pol Pot LLP (or just Stalin Mao, as they'd be known) would look something like this:  Josef Stalin:  Education: Revolutionary University, LL.B., magna cum laude (1918); Law Review: Agitation Editor; Order of the Sickle  Josef Stalin is one of the senior partners at the firm. Before forming Stalin Mao, he was a founding partner at Stalin & Associates (formerly Lenin, Trotsky & Stalin), where during his tenure he was an international trail-blazer in the practice area of Gulag law. Stalin's experience include representing plaintiffs in  Collectivizers v. Peasants , which resulted in a verdict of mass starvation, and  In re Great Patriotic War .   Mao Zedong:  Education: Revolutionary University, LL.B., summa cum laude (1921); Law Review: Propaganda Editor; Order of the Sickle  Mao Zedong is one of the industry's top rainmakers in corporate and population re-structuring law. He was formerly the managing partner at the most populous law firm/communist state in the world before joining Stalin Mao. There he oversaw the complex process of deindustrializing an entire country and engineering the stavation of some 30 million people. Mao also holds an adjunct position at Revolution University Law School and regularly teaches a course on Law and Cultural Revolution.   Erich Honecker:   Education: Die Revolutionare Universitat (1969); Law Review: Secret Police Editor; Yale Law School, LL.M. (1971);  Erich Honecker is the lead partner in the firm's M&A practice group. Among his major transactions is the acqusition of his former firm by its arch-rival and westernly neighbor.    Pol Pot:  Education: (Self Taught)  Pol Pot heads the Education Law practice group at Stalin Mao, and is one of the most recognized scholars writing and acting on the subject. He authored the seminal article on the relationship between communism and intellectuals, entitled  Why The Part Needs to Kill Everyone Who's Had More Than An Elementary-School Education  25 Duq. L.J. 317 (1974). Unlike most scholars, Pol Pot was also able to carry out the reforms proposed in his article. In addition to his role at the firm, Pol Pot is also the chairman of the CLE committee at the state bar association.           \n",

      "              Readings on SEX(ual harassment)  Laura Kipnis at Slate has an amusing   essay  on the Naomi Wolf story. Her basic point is that sexual advances made by co-workers aren't necessarily always threatening and disempowering, sometimes they're just absurdly funny and rather empowering, since it gives these (almost always) women the awesome power of the rejection. Of course, when that co-worker is also a boss, the issue becomes slightly less funny. Kipnis also proposes the idea that men who make these advances, even though they occupy positions of power and prestige, often do so out of insecurity and a need for validation rather than as an exercise in some phallic expression of dominance. The case she picked seems to support her point.   Wolf recently made public her experience of being hit on by her intellectual hero and mentor, the (apparently, I don't know who he is) eminent Harold Bloom, an experience so revolting that she threw up after being propositioned. Wolf, who is now a (apparently, I don't know who she is) famous and respected authority in her field (of something or the other), claims that she is still haunted by the experience.   It is in making this claim that Kipnis thinks is going too far. After all, given Wolf's current position none of the potential harms associated with an unwanted sexual advance exist, and all of the potentially empowering and humorous effects still do. Kipnis advises that situations like this one are not necessarily so uncommon, and that we should not always think about workplace chat-ups as 'damsels-in-distress narratives.' She closes: '[t]he power actually doesn't flow in only one direction in these encounters, nor does the vulnerability, even when the professional roles aregasp!asymmetrical. Sisters are powerful too, even more so when armed with a sense of humor.'   Also, an   article  on a case on the Supreme Court's docket about whether an employer should be held strictly liable for sexual harassment when an employee quits (as oppose to being fired) because of an intolerably hostile work environment. I post this because of the unfortunate name of 'constructive discharge' given to the act of quitting because of a hostile environment.           \n",

      "              And they expect me to pay  how  much in tuition??  It seems that CEO's and Baseball players named Rodriguez aren't the only ones making a killing these days. Harvard University announced recently that it is putting a cap on the compensation paid out to the managers of its endowment investments. Yes, Harvard has by far the largest endowment in the country and one that has grown at an extraordinary pace in the last ten years, but that hardly justifies the compensation these glorified stock-jockies were getting.  The combined compensation for the six highest paid employees of the management company last year exceeded $100 million, with Maruice Samuels earning $35.1 million, David Mittelman earning $34.1 million, and Barry Larson earned a lowly $17.3 million, which was apparently so pathetic that Mr. Larson is leaving along with a dozen or so other Havard Management Co. employees to found their own hedge fund. But don't worry, the money will be following them, as the university has agreed to invest $700 million of its assets with the new company.

I definiely want to go, but I'm kind of embarassed by what I'm doing this year (paralegal) because it's so lame generally and particularly unoriginal for law students. So, I've been trying to invent a fictional occupation for myself for this past year, something that's interesting but also implausible enough not to be taken literally. I also would feel really bad lying about doing things that I think are really pretty worthy, i.e. teaching elementary school or anything else socially valuable.

      "              Sights  On my walk from the subway back home today I saw this man, he must have been in his 50's, riding a tiny little bicycle. The bike had a detached car radio stuck on the to handles, and the radio was connected to a small boombox, with which he played loud salsa music as he cruised down the street. I wonder if he needed the car radio because the boombox's radio was broken, but then why couldn't he just get smaller speakers to play the car radio? It was probably a fashion thing; fifty year-old Spanish guys are always the trend setters.   What's next, their own cable cooking show?  The Times Sunday Magazine has a short   article  about a   philosophy professor at CCNY  who has his own counseling practice (over which he's currently in litigation against his own university). The guy's claim, which is somewhat plausible, is that many if not most of the problems people go or contemplate going to see a psychiartrist or clinical psychologist about are really philosophical problems that can be solved with the help of a trained socratic interlocutor, i.e. philosophy professors. Lots of times our problems arise from faulty logic or muddled and confused values. Everyone at some point or another has questions about ethics, the meaning of life and happiness, what's truly valuable, and so forth. Philosophers are really best trained to handle these problems, and can do so in less time and at less expensee than medical doctors.   The mental health profession, of course, strongly opposes the idea of philosophers dispensing advice. Their claim, also plausible, is that people who really may need medical help will not be getting it by going to philosophers waxing on and on about Plato or Aquinas or Kierkegaard. One never knows if a philosopher would prescribe Sarte for a suicidal despressive or Nietzsche for a paranoid schizophrenic.  This actually reminds me of an amazingly similar scheme a friend in college had (he's probably not going to read this since he's in Hondurar with the Peace Corps.). His service was called 'Justify Your Wrong-Doing,' and provides, well, pretty much what it advertises. Say that your conscience was bothering you because you made up some bogus excuse in turning in your paper late, or that you cheated on your taxes or something. Just call and explain your situation, and my friend would explain why your actions were, after all, perfectly justifiable if not affirmatively virtuous. He rates were 50 cents for minor sins, and a 1 dollar for major sins. Considering that, accoridng to the article, executives at companies like IBM and GE have made philosophers tens of thousands of dollars for fancied-up versions of the same thing, I'm very surprised that he never had any customers.   I was thinking though, that head-shrinking is not the only option available to philosophers who want to 'practice.' So, in no particular, here are 11 promising careers fit for the professional philosopher:  11. Career-counselor. For those philosophers, like Aristotle (who, since he's one of the few philosopher I know, will figrue largely in this list), have a teleology, career-counseling is a fantastic option. So many young people today are completely lost in the wide array of choice available to them that a philosophical exploration into what they're meant to become would definitely be in demand. Philosophers would have this market cornered in no time with advice like 'Being a medical orderly is fulfilling your true destiny.' Probably only soft determinists or compatibilists should try out for these jobs - see #7 below...  10. Information Technology Manager. For philosophers of mind, this is a perfect opportunity to work all the time with the latest computers to see if they are or can become intelligent beings. Unless you work for a university, in which case you'll have four-year-old technology.  9. Investment manager. For Midieval philosophers. This job normally entails explaining to lots of people why all of their money is gone even though they invested in 'hot' stocks like Enron and Worldcom and bubbleEconomy.com. The people with degrees in economics offer explanations like 'this is just a market correction,' or 'the fundamentals of the company are strong, never mind the lack of assets or a business plan,' or 'I didn't know the officers were all crooks.' But only philosophers can tell the straight story, that this is simply all the work of Fortuna, on whose wheel all of us spin from the pinnacle to the nadir. Instead of reading Warren Buffet (I don't know if he even writes anything...), the philosopher investment manager would direct his clients to read   Boethius' The Consolation of Philosophy .  8. Military Communications Officer. For all philosophers. The military uses a lot of jargon totally incomprehensible to outsiders for every little thing. So do philosophers. This is a perfect match, and you get the added credibility of a Ph.D.  7. Fortune-teller, for the hard determinists, those philosophers who do not believe in free will. All mental functions are caused by chemical reactions in the brain, and these chemical reactions follow the laws of physics. In any physical system, or at least those at the scale of neurotransmitter activity, if we know the current positions and velocity of each particle, we could theoretically calculate their positions into the indefinite future. So, given enough information and calculating power, these philosophers could tell you who you're going to marry, whether you'll make Law Review, and whether you'll ever get rid of that weird looking growth. But the marketing will probably be pretty hard without the crystal ball and all those weird playing cards.  6. Match-maker. For any philosopher who did his or her dissertation on Books VIII and IX of the  Nicomachean Ethics  on friendship. They will know which people are truly meant to be together for life, probably; I don't know, I've never read the  Ethics .   5. Stand up comedian, er, philosopher. This idea was from Mel Brook's hilarious   History of the World Part I . Philosophers of language would do well in this gig. After all, so many jokes really just exploit the vague areas of meaning and language. 'And what's the deal with the demonstrative pronoun? I mean, it's suppose to refer to physical objects, but it's just a signifier for other words! What genius thought of this one?' I think I'd be more worried if that last joke were actually funny...  4. Interior Decorator. Actually, I think phenomenologists have a lot of options for practice, pretty much anything that deals with qualia, or the  experience  of experiencing, that are too vague or complicated for normal people to be want to assess on their own. Restaurant critics would be a pretty good job for phenomenologists. But  feng shui  seems to be all the rage these days, and that's all about the most ineffable of qualia.  3. Fashion Designer. For philosopher of aethetics. This is related to #4. I originally thought that aethetics would be good for interior design since it's nominally concerned with beauty and all that. But actually, just like fashion designers with their weird runway shows, philsophers of beauty seem more concerned with conceptual questions rather than practical ones. Philsophers be ideal for this job, since they can design outfits that no one will ever wear, and still make a good argument as to the value of making them(something about the intrinsic value of beautiful things, like the distant-plant example. E-mail me if you don't know what I'm talking about, or e-mail me if you do know what I'm talking about because I probably don't know what I'm talking about).  2. Taxidermist. Philosphers would make great quality control experts in a taxidermy practice. 'Is this elephant stuffed? Is it stuffed now that I've taken out one grain of sand? After two? After three? After four?.... I've just removed the last grain of sand, is it still stuffed? No? Then you better go and stuff it.'  1. Lawyer.  Haha, no, just kidding. Thanks for reading the rest of the list though.          \n",

      "              Has the Fear already gripped me?   I report to first-year orientation for law school in 164 days. I won't be allowed to even try to apply for first-year summer jobs for another 92 days on top of that, and I likely will not have to make any meaningful decision about whether and which firm summer job to accept until the winter of my  second  year, or 164+90+365+... well you get the idea.  But I'm already starting to do something that can be called a sorry excuse for research into my employment prospects. I started a spread sheet a few weeks ago, and have been slowly trying to fill in the data points, as if these numbers and boolean values mean anything. Example fields include raw data from the   NALP  like:   starting salary (which turns out to be the least helpful since they're all mostly the same),  bonus criteria,  partnership length and structure,  salary divided by weekly-hours-worked, associates-to-partners-ratio, summer hiring numbers, size of dinner allowance for all those late nights at the office  and also a myriad of indices, based on surveys from sources like   this , and   this :  Family friendliness, Quality of work assigned, Self-esteem, How satisfying work is,   NYLawyer.com  Misery-Index number [oh if only there were such a thing!]  I noticed that nowhere is my spreadsheet is there a column for the firms' practice area, which, one might think is an important piece of information to assimilate. I think part of the reason is that this type of data is not Excel-friendly, or at least I don't know how to make it Excel-friendly. But it's also because I have no idea what these practice areas mean much less any idea of whether or not I want to practice in them. So, short of finding a firm (or even a partner, really) that specializes in 'sitting around discussing stuff that's interesting and kind of related to the law but probably is not profitable for any of our clients, oh wait we don't have any anymore,' I don't think listing all of the practice groups will help me at this point.  Not that listing gathering any of this data helps, really. But I think my total indifference to and non-participation in the undergraduate recruiting process, and the resulting clueless job-search for this year has made me acutely fearful of being unprepared when the time does arrive. It also doesn't help that so many people I know, save those who are already locked-in the professional or grad-school track, are having the same if not worse problems with finding a good, satifsying job that could maybe translate into a good, satisfying career.   This is largely just due to my characteristic risk-aversion. [On a side note that's sort of related to risk, I've discovered that Slinkies make excellent spill-guards on one's desk. I'm putting my soft drink cans in the slinky so that I won't accidentally knock them over and spill Diet Coke all over original documents... again.] But a lot of it is also, I think, attributable to the mood of the legal profession and beyond. The attitude among so many intelligent, highly educated, and idealistic people in and out of law school is that money (and the associated security, comfort, and in many cases familial and filial duty) and fulfillment (of intellect and of conscience) necessarily or at least often contingently are trade-offs. Given this trade off, any decision you make will make you either a sell-out, possibly content but probably unhappy , or a pauper, possibly good-doing but probably ineffectual. How to decide!  Of course, the prospects are not really this grim. But I also don't believe that the path beyond this trade-off lies in banal refrains like 'just do what you want and what interests you.' It's surely a lot more complicated than just an act of will. And I think what drives people into jobs they hate is not just a fear of failure, but a fear of complexity as well. So for those of us who lack Zarathustrian will, a little information-gathering might not be such a bad idea.          \n",

      "              Readings   In the New York Review of Books, Jared Diamond, of   Guns, Germs, and Steel  fame,   writes  about two recent books on Easter Island. The story of Eastern Island is amazing in two aspects. First, there are those mysterious giant heads that everyone's heard about. But what is even more interesting is the rise and fall of the civilization that build those giant heads.   It must take both a highly organized society and an island abundant in natural sources (for Easter Island is the most geographically remote place on Earth, so all of the raw materials must have been indigenous) to make possible the quarrying, transporting, and building of these statues. But Eastern Island today is uninhabited and void of trees taller than seven feet. When Europeans happened upon the island they found the inhabitants to be 'small, lean, timid, and miserable.' What the explorers did not know at the time was that the population of the island declined drastically in the century or so before their arrival, accompanying the general collapse of the island's human civilzation and natural wealth.   Experts on the subject seem to agree that Easter Island is a natural example of the nightmare scenarios projected by environmentalists if humans continue to strip the Earth of natural resources with our present disregard. Diamond wonders if, like we do today, the Easter Islanders thought that technological innovation would save the day before all of their natural resources run out? Sadly, it didn't.   Incidently, I've been seeing all of these ads in the New York subways from BP, about how the company is investigating new energy technologies and so on. And the ads all say 'beyond petroleum' like they want you to think that that's what BP stands for. It is, of course, the merged non-representational acronym for British Petroleum (ah,  that's  what BP stands for) and Amoco, the world's silver medalist in oil conglomeration.   And I just realized that I've pretty much summed up an article that is itself a not-too-long book review... I feel like such a bottom-feeder. In my defense, Diamond does refer to the two books in the review -  The Enigmas of Easter Island  by John Flenley and Paul Bahn, and  Among Stone Giants  by Jo Anne Van Tilburg - as 'difficult.'           \n",

      "              I'm not an grad student; grad students go to meetings....  A very funny piece of what an AA meeting might sound like if it were   'Grad. Students Anonymous'  instead. That it was written by two tenured professors at Amherst College lends, I think, a bit of credibility to it - we can see that even people who have 'made it' went through this kind of crippling angst.  It seems that everything I read about the life of grad students and young phd's is a lot like what I hear about young associates, an endless stream of complaints, regrets, and warnings. But surely  some  abd's and phd's must lead fulfilling lives. Maybe it's selection bias. After all, the   Chronicle of Higher Education  seems to be a repository of bitching and moaning from humanities students and part-time faculty, presumably because the science grad students and full time faculty have better things to do with their times. The possibility of careers in industy is like a valve that takes some of the pressure out of the academic pipeline for science phd's, but I imagine that physicists, mathematicians, and everyone else interested in basic research are competing for very few spots in academia also. Maybe it's something about the temperment of those drawn to graduate programs in philosophy, history, and the granddaddy of them all, English, that leads to all this agonizing.   Or maybe it is just the reality of the phd program and the job market. One thing I hear a lot about is the pressure to write about the most esoteric and irrelevant topics for your dissertation because it is only on the extreme margins that a lowly grad student with limited funds and time can hope to contribute something new enough to qualify as original research. My favorite professor from college is writing about some really interesting and at least somewhat topical stuff now, but did his dissertation on 'hermeneutics' or some other such word that I can neither spell nor define.

With a some luck and hard work, who knows, I may emerge from school a little older, a little more cynical, a lot more debt-ridden, and a lot less employable. Cheers to me!          \n",

      "              Readings   I'm a Democrat. I'm a liberal. And I've been thinking a lot about the shift in the American electorate to the right. One of the most puzzling questions for many liberals is why, since the economic bubble burst, do so many Americans whose economic interests should and have historically aligned with the Democrats continue to support George Bush and the Republicans in increasing numbers. An examination of both present conditions and the explicit economic philosophy of the GOP, or at the very least one's own bank account, should lead people who've suffered because of corporate scandals, de-regulation, job flight, de-industrialization, and regressive taxes to vote Republicans out of office. Instead, the majority of 'Red' Americans (as oppose to 'Blue' Americans), a shorthand for those living in states that went GOP in 2000, love Bush and despise Democrats.  There is quite a bit of literature on this phenomenon. The latest addition is Thomas Frank's article in April issue of   Harper's ,  Lie Down for America: How the Republican party Sows Ruin on the Great Plains . Frank tells the by now familiar stories of low-income Americans in the heartland 'converting' to the Republican Party from families with long ties to the Democrats dating back to FDR and the New Deal. Like others, including David Brooks in his   Atlantic  essay from January, 2001, Frank attributes these conversions to cultural rather than economic causes. Red Americans (alas, to think that that term a generation ago invoked something so completely different...) simply 'got sick of being scolded for eating meat or for wearing clothes emblazoned with the State U's Indian mascot.' The liberals, they think to themselves, have gone too far. America needs to go back to its roots, and the people to take here there will be the Red Americans from the heartland, where the traditional values or humility, patriotism, courteousness, and diligence still prevail.   Their response, or backlash, to use Frank's word, was to vote for the socially conservative (instead of progressive), unpretentious (instead of critical) Republicans, whose Platonic Ideal is given human form in George W. Bush.  The tragedy of this response, however, is that these same Republicans haven't delivered on the culture war front. What have done over and over again, is roll back all of the economic controls put in place over the last 60 years, causing the wealth gap to widen to a chasm unprecedented 'in our lifetimes.'   Frank suggests, though does not state outright, that Republicans are merely using the Values talk as a politically potent way to sneak in their economic reforms: '[t]he leaders of the backlash may talk Christ, but they walk corporate.' I don't think this is all a whole lot of hot air. I believe the conservatives try and thankfully fail on the major social issues, in large part thanks to the Court (Gratz v. Bollinger, Lawrence v. Texas, the decision reaffirming Roe whose name I can't be bothered to look up), or at least to four laudable Justices and the odd straggler. The result for Red Americans voting their temper and emotions, however, remains the same: '[v]ote to stop abortion; receive rollback in capital-gains taxes. Vote to make country strong again; receive deindustrialization. [and my favorite!] Vote to screw those politically correct college professors; receive electricity deregulation [and blackouts....]' And so on and so on.  At this point in the article, I'm  totally  stoked to find out what Frank thinks is causing so many Americans to continue to vote against their own best interests, because, let's remember, they're getting screwed economically and they're  not  getting to stick it to those latte-drinking, veggie-eating, tree-hugging, fag-loving, baby-killing, Jesus-hating, graduate-degree-earning Blue Americans.  Sadly, what Frank actually writes is a well crafted deconstruction of the 'myth' of places like Kansas being somehow 'authentically' American. A   deconstruction!!   Well, at least Frank got his Ph.D. at  just  the University of Chicago instead of one of those snobby elite northeastern schools you hear so much about. Fine, so the stereotype of Red Americans as wholesome hard working stiffs is exploded, in part with words like 'vituperate,' and the French  affaire  instead of scandal. I bet you learn words like that in graduate school.  And then Frank moves on to some anecdotal examples of just how the free market has screwed over Kansasians, and we're still left with same question we started with: why are these people voting against their own interests? No, sorry, we're also left knowing that Kansas is, after all, not the mythological place populated with hearty, honest, hard-working Americans who long for honest presidents like Herbert Hoover, or maybe still think they live under Herbert Hoover. But I think few of us believed that to begin with. Yet, I'm no closer to understanding what is causing the radical shift of this country to the right, and all the article left me feeling is a sense of helplessness and inevitability. Indeed, Frank closes his piece with a sentence alluding to a cosmic mandate for the status quo. 'All Kansas asks today is a little help nailing itself to that cross of gold.'   So, I feel pretty sucky after reading this article, as I often do actually after reading anything Harper's, or, for that matter, anything in   Mother Jones , and much of the rest of the liberal intellectual literature. Of course, I agree with most of what these authors stand for in their politics, but it's still really depressing to be constantly told that there is so much injustice in the world, and worse, that its all here today, because the problems run too deep and the good guys are all too weak and marginalized. Racial inequality in education is so bad that aggressive across the board affirmative action at universities for a whole generation is not enough, and may never be enough. Racism in the use of police power is so pervasive that we as a society cannot be tough on crime without unjustly imprisoning African-Americans. Sexism is so harmful in the workplace that the most casual remarks can lead to a multimillion dollar law suit. Poverty is so crushing that healthy people on welfare can't go back to work full time to 'earn' their pay checks. And the Holy Grail of Helplessness for the intellectual Left: every time you think you're trying to solve a problem you're really actually acting out of some of sub-conscious motivation which is itself shaped by an all-powerful morally agnostic force like Capitalism.  As much as I believe in criticizing what is wrong with the world, and as much as I believe that the statements above are true, too often I get the feeling that its all a lot of shrill whining. Imagine what someone who disagrees the substantive politics must think of liberals!   I agree with Frank that a lot of people probably get turned off by liberals criticizing their lifestyles and beliefs. But maybe it also has to do with the psychologically empowering message being broadcasted by the conservatives: This is your America and it's just fine thank you very much! The only problem we have is all you hyper-critical self-hating liberals going around saying that the sky is falling down.   So let's all forget about our problems, keep the Chicken Littles out of power, and buy bigger bombs with our dwindling pay checks to and drop them people in other countries. See, now they have more problems than we do.          \n",

      "              News   An interesting   article  in this morning's Times about language and identity in China and Japan. Apparently in Japan there is a law that list the permitted words that parents can use as children's names, presumably so that you don't get the Japanese equivalents of names like  Final , or  Boat , or  [Father's Name] 2.0  (these are real).   The the article also notes that foreign nationals of Japanese ancestry, upon their return to Japan, receive names in the Japanese alphabet reserved for foreign words. This leaves an indelible mark on the identity of overseas- Japanese that adds to their existing though lessening social ostracism in Japan. The author goes on to contrast this phenomenon with the more accepting character of the Chinese to their overseas brethren.   A few thoughts. I wonder what this comparison says about the strength, stability, and cohesion of identity and culture generally for populations in diaspora. It seems like it could go both ways. One can argue that Chinese culture has a stronger sense of Volk because the bonds that hold individuals together survive geographic and generational distance, so that a fourth generation Chinese-American would still be considered 'Chinese' when he goes back to the old country, while a second generation Japanese-Peruvian would instead be considered 'from that country over there.'  But one can also argue that Chinese identity, because it is so malleable and accepting, becomes vacuous or at least significantly diluted for those who were born and have lived abroad. I think the problem of form over substance is particularly acute for the Chinese, who largely do not have the benefits of a home-grown religion or secular equivalent that would serve as a common tradition and set of practices. This absence also make overseas Chinese more susceptible to religious or secular conversion that would further dilute the substance of Chinese culture. Still, it seems that as long as one of the two conditions, ethnicity and geography, is true, then one is considered Chinese.  The bond of soil and identity in the case of the Japanese is more restrictive. Here is a case where culture (or nation, to use a more old-fashioned word) and state do not merely overlap but also seem to define one another. One can be fully Japanese only if one lives in Japan, and one can fully live in Japan (in the psychological sense) only if one were ethnically Japanese.   At the other end of the extreme is the least restrictive bond between identity and geography for citizens of states that are multicultural born and bred - the U.S. and Canada being examples, as oppose to multicultural states that were cobbled together by history - Belgium and Bosnia Herzegovina (and also China) being examples. In the case of the former, identity is contingent upon  neither  ethnicity nor geography. These cultures are far more vulnerable if removed from the mother country precisely because they are so fluid.   It's easy to overlook this aspect now for two related reasons. First, Anglo-American culture is so ubiquitous that one can pretty much find an outpost of it or elements thereof anywhere in the world. Second, the English-speaking countries, of the New World at least, are still very very attractive places to live. But suppose at some point in the future America and Canada become net emigrant countries, and the dominance of McCulture ebbs. By what will the members of an American diaspora define themselves? Language is one possibility; but at the present rate at which English mutates and spreads throughout the world it will likely soon become an even more bastardized tongue than it already is, making it very difficult for 'native' speaks to carve out a strong, discrete identity for themselves based on nuances of language alone.  Political theorists have suggested that liberal civic and political values are sufficient to form the substance of an culture. Jeremy Waldron (25 U. Mich. Law Rev. 757 (1992)) also argues that, in the liberal democracies, there is the advent of a distinct cosmopolitan culture that is more than a shallow overlap of existing cultures and indeed, takes on an identity all to its own.  But cultures by these definitions have serious survivability problems, as they both depend on very fertile sociopolitical environments to exist. (Ironically, Waldron uses his example of the cosmopolitan culture as an argument against state protections of and exemptions for minority cultures, when in fact a cosmopolitan culture is probably the least self-sufficient culture imaginable - try being [to paraphrase Waldron] an English-speaking Aussie who eat Thai food and listens to German opera if everyone around you speaks only Portuguese, has never heard of music with string instruments, and doesn't know what Thai food is.) They require states that are, well, liberal and/or cosmopolitan.   Perhaps the most important function of a culture is to provide meaning and social support for a person, or rather a people of sufficient critical mass, regardless of the external social or political circumstances, provided that they are not overtly and aggressively hostile. It doesn't seem to me that a liberal or cosmopolitan 'culture' is able to provide these things under any but the most ideal conditions.   Everyone can feel a little Irish on St. Patrick's Day when there's an enormous parade marching down 5th Avenue a block from one's office. But one would probably have to  be  Irish to get that same feeling on some dusty bomb-ridden road outside Tikrit.          \n",

      "              Impatiently Waiting   I have about 6 weeks left before I leave my job, hopefully. There are bunch of things to do between now and then, not the least of which is finding someone to take over my apartment. Then there is summer, which I'm very excited about. I also spend a lot of time thinking about starting law school in the Fall, and as lame as it is to say, I can't wait to go.  I've heard a lot of different things about law school. Most of the evaluations range from ambivalence  to downright despair, except from those who are already out and practicing; for them law school was an idyllic time, but I guess that reflects more on being a lawyer than on being a law student. Thoughts about the profession also trouble me, but that's a whole different story.  Despite what I've heard though I'm genuinely looking forward to school. Maybe it's the occasional light-hearted anecdote, like when one young associate at the firm told me about 'Gunner Bingo' tournaments. She made law school sound much less overwhelming than what I've heard form a lot of places, and her refrain 'you go to class, you do the reading, you get a B. It's not heavy lifting' is reassuring. It's also the chance to back on a campus, which offers so many other intellectual and quality of life benefits not found on the outside, very few of them having to do with actual course work, naturally. I want to have time to read again, and to discuss ideas with people who are reading the same things I am. I want to write again, and have topics that interest me and the resources and guidance to help me along. And I want to learn to play squash, and not at a place that has the words 'Yale' and 'Club' in its name.  But I worry too. There are so many people who are a whole lot sharper than I am, and a bunch of others who are probably reading through their 1L course outlines now while still in college, and who will be asking their friends for old exams during the summer - I bet I could guess who these people are from my school. I worry I won't be competitive for all the thing that law-type people go after, like Law Review and appellate clerkships and so on, and I worry that I'll be complacent and just settle on the grades, on the job. I don't think I'd have trouble putting in the work in school, but for every little bit I do a bunch of other people are surely doing a lot more, especially with a class of more than 500 students.   So I'm trying to prepare as much as I can before school, psychologically, and, for lack of a better term I'll call administratively, a.k.a. getting my shit together, (almost) literally. I figure it's best to go in ready to  start all the academic work and not worry about the adjustment and career-related distractions.    But I am going to remain doggedly ignorant of what is actually taught in law school. I don't want to on the wrong side of Gunner Bingo; I want to win those prizes.          \n",

      "              Readings   Lawrence Lessig has a disenchanting   essay  this month about his personal experience with Supreme Court advocacy. In it he writes about how the Court completely ignored what seems like pretty solid reasoning, and voted based on entrenched property interests. It's not a whining piece though; Lessig concludes that he should have played up the political aspects of the case rather than harp only on the legal minutiae during oral arguments.   In other news , Ulster County in upstate New York has   charged  a Unitarian minister for performing gay marriages, alleging that he solemnized marriages without licenses. The major of New Paltz, NY was also charged for doing the same.   It's unclear to me why prosecution is a necessary or even effective deterrent in this case. If a state does not recognize gay marriages, then whether or not the clergy perform ceremonies, whether or not they considered the ceremonies 'civil,' as the Unitarian minister apparently did in this case. The civil effects of the ceremony are nonexistent, and no one is going to mistakenly think that all of a sudden gay marriages are legal in the State of New York.    Still, the prosecution probably thought that the whole thing would result in a plea bargain guilty plea, followed by a slap on the wrist. The clergy walk away, and blackletter law triumphs. But, as one might expect, both defendants are planning to litigate the case and probably appeal and appeal when they lose at the trial level, resulting in a repeat in New York of the California gay marriage cases from these past few weeks. This strikes me as a needless waste of court resources and a gratuitous salvo in the culture wars - then again that's probably what the prosecutors were trying to do in the first place.  This case also potentially raises some freedom of religion concerns, since the person performing the ceremonies was not a city employee, as was the case in California and in New Paltz, but a minister. I don't think that there is much of a debate here though, since the minister in this particular instance was clearly performing these ceremonies in the capacity of a public official, as an act of civil disobedience. I can understand the state wanting to reign in its own employees for flouting the law, but that it would go out of its way to harass clergymen (Unitarian no less!) evidences some malicious intent behind the act.                \n",

      "              News   David Brooks's   Op-ed  in today's Times charges the Spanish electorate with appeasing terrorist the world over by voting the Socialists in to power in Sunday's elections. While Brooks concedes the possibility that unrelated domestic factors actually determined the election, he unambiguously believes that the  perception  of the vote will be that of Spaniards capitulating to terrorists exacting retribution for Spain's support of the United States.  All of this seems at first like egocentric American hysteria. The Popular Party is a right-of-center party, which has traditionally not been in power in Spain's post-Franco history. The government had also fallen out of favor with the electorate as early as a year ago, when there were massive protests against Spain's sending troops to Iraq. One can conclude that the Spanish electorate had plenty of other reasons to be pissed-off with the current government, and that its ousting was an overdetermined event.   Moreover, there is the idea particularly on the Left, that the attacks themselves had nothing to do with Spain's relationship with the United States. One increasingly-incredible view is that ETA was, after all, behind the attacks, and that the Al-Qaeda link is some paranoid American conspiracy theory. Another more nuanced position is that various North African Islamist groups have their own long-standing beef with the Spanish government, which though it may haven been aggravated by the Iraq war, was certainly not predicated on it.  Thus, although these groups may be behind the attacks in Madrid, Americans are wrong to lump the people and motives behind them together with those of Al-Qaeda and its sympathizers.  A couple of things give me pause about these latter two views. The evidence coming in suggest strongly against ETA being the culprit in the attacks. So even if the Al-Qaeda link is a conspiracy theory, it is not a merely American conspiracy theory. In fact, a Socialist   Deputy  says that the voters were angry with the  government  for trying to blame the ETA for the attacks. The same Financial Times article reports that Spanish political analysts are saying that had ETA been responsible for the attacks, then the Popular Party would have easily won the election, as the polls all along showed they would.   The inference to draw from this information is that, rather than being an overdetermined event, the Socialist victory was a direct and proximate result of the terrorist attacks, believed to be perpetrated by groups linked or sympathetic to Al-Qaeda. So, the Spanish people became, overnight, massively more dissatisfied with their government's foreign and security policy, but why? It seems unlikely that the motivation is simply capitulation out of fear. Rather, one can take the position that Spain's involvement in Iraq is a distraction from the broader fight against extremism and terrorism, and so the Socialists' vocal platform against a continued Spanish presence there would be a stronger rather than weaker stance against terrorism.   But Brooks's argument about perception is still a persuasive one. Even if the people who actually attacked Spain couldn't give a monkey about the United States, Iraq, or for the sake of argument, Islam, it is still true that the correlation of events looks very encouraging to future terrorists, even if (or especially if) their interpretation of the events, like Brooks', mine, and the Spanish electorate's, were totally wrong.   One hopes terrorists are more perceptive and sophisticated.          \n",

      "              Do I Really Want to Read 448 Pages on This?   Alan Wolfe writes a   review  of Sam Huntington's new book    Who Are We?  in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs.  Apparently, Huntington is now worried not so much about civilizations clashing but rather sneaking across the border and threatening the nice little Anglo-Protestant thing we've got going on in this country. Wolfe's summary of the basic argument is that the new waves of immigration, particularly from non-European countries, is threatening the cultural make-up of the United States with alarming sociopolitical implications. Specifically, the cultural traditions that gave birth to and nurished a dynamic republic that values individual rights and democratic procedures, and to a citizenry that is active in the preservation and extension of these rights and procedures, is jeopardized by a growing population that is at best indifferent and at best apathetic and at worst hostile to these traditions. Moreover, the new waves of immigrants are, unlike their counterparts from generations past, increasingly less susceptible to cultural and political assimilation. The end result of this trend is that the citizens of this country will become less and less patriotic, liberal, and democratic.  Huntington's is not a new argument. Wolfe writes that the sentiments (and indeed they are just that, sentiments, not    reasons   or   data  ) are eerily similar to the nativist bellyaching last heard in the Nineteenth Century. Indeed, Huntington writes that nativism will likely return in force if the immigration trend continues, and especially if the economic downturn continues as well. There are two planks of the nativist argument, one more convincing than the other, but both ultimately flawed.  The first argument is unabashedly selfish. Its premises are that (1) a wealthy country's economy can sustain a certain (comfortable) standard of living for only so many people, (2) people who are already in a country have the right to exclude   all  those who are not already there. What is the justification for the second premise? Is it something as simple as 'I was here first?' This position sounds intutive, and is in line with the Anglo-Protestant tradition mentioned by Huntington. Bruce Ackerman writes what I think is a well-crafted (and funny) response to this position in his   Social Justice and the Liberal State   (1981). Ackerman's point is that unless we reduce a country to be the   private  property of its first inhabiters, a position I don't think even the staunchest of nativists advocate, there can be no justification for excluding immigrants on the basis of who got there first. If timing were really the only justification, then we'd arrive at the perverse conclusion that the children of citizens are in no more favorable position to be granted citizenship than immigrants, since they arguably 'arrive' later than do adult immigrants.  Speaking of which, the last episode of this season's South Park does a very clever take on the whole immigration thing. In the episode, South Park is flooded with 'immigrants' from the future. This is not a techno-savy, Star Trekkie future, but rather a poverty-stricken, labor-glutted, modern-day-developing-country resembling future. These immigrants are quite literally the progeny of the current generation of South Park citizens. In the episode, the citizens of South Park protest against the new immigrants from the future driving down wages and taking every one's jobs. (With this comes the catch-phrase 'They took ahr jahbs!' inspired surely by the now immortal Cartman 'Respect my Ah-thor-eh-Tah!' from the show's early years.') The irony in this episode is that the people of South Park are trying to exclude like foreign immigrants the very same people that navtivists claim to be saving the country for, their own future generations. The characters' ultimate solution to their problem is to try to prevent the future peoples from ever coming into existence. How they try to make this happen is much to profane (and hilarious) to write about here.  The second variant of the nativist argument is more clever is more insidious. It holds that what sets, say, Americans apart from others and what gives current Americans and their children rights to exclude others is not who got here first. Rather, it is the values they hold and the principles they support. The first premise of this argument is that liberal democratic countries are worth preserving and that liberal democratic citizens are preferable to non-liberal, non-democratic citizens for that task. Sounds fine, no argument from me, or from most other liberal I suspect. The second premise is that liberal democracies are dependent on certain values that exist in some but not all cultural traditions, and that these values must be perpetually present in order for the continued existence of liberal democracy. This premise is explicitly opposed to the idea of the Founding Fathers that a virtuous system of government does not need virtuous citizens in order to survive (and the converse that virtuous citizens need not a virtuous system of government). I think most liberals would grant this premise up to a certain point, namely that you'd probably need citizens who were not all overtly and committedtly hostile to ideas like democracy and individual rights. But short of that, people who are not culturally familiar with liberal principles should be fairly easily convinced of liberalism's virtues once they have lived, gone to school, and worked in the United States for some years, and certainly after a generation.  'Ah ha,' the Nativist might say, 'these new immigrants don't associate with the rest of America. They stay in their own linguistic communities wherein the the important values and principles of Anglo-Protestantism can't penetrate.' Part of this is surely true. Now, as before, many immigrants tend to move to little cultural enclaves and live amongst others who share their language, traditions, dress, cuisine and so forth. And this is important and valuable for other peoples as well, for without the critical of distinct cultural communities the broader liberal society would not be able to enjoy the cosmopolitan lifestyle so many claim to cherish.   The phenonmenon of cultural enclaves in the cities and towns of America is certainly not a historical novelty of the late Twentieth Century. Waves of immigrants in the past settled first in the little ethnic neighborhoods in cities like New York, and slowly over the years and generations moved away from the city and into the suburbs (or uptown) where homogeneity is no longer in terms of language or religion but rather by income bracket and motor-vehicle preference.   Moreover, we should consider that all of the previous generations of immigrants assimilated politico-culturally to this country before the availability of the 24-hour news cycle, a dozen cable news stations, and hundreds of Internet sites devoted to civic-ish stuff. The saturation of media in society is at a significantly higher level than it had been at any time in the past, and the invisible walls that separate the enthnic neighborhoods from the broader society are no match for the trumpets of an all-pervasive American Culture.  Without any data beyond some skimpy ones cited by Wolfe on hand, I cannot say that immigrants today are in fact assimilating culturally at a comparable rate as had those in the past. But if in fact Huntington is right, and peoples immigrating to America are less likely to adopt and internalize the important civic virtues that previous generations had, I would submit that perhaps it is not due to some changes in the quantity or quality of those who are seeking a new life here, but rather due to changes in American culture itself.  To list one possible contributing cause, I would observe that media explosion in the last generation has done a great deal to fragment the American identity and American culture. Not only are Americans spending more and more time in front of the television, the video game console, and the computer than they'd ever had in the past, they are also no longer sharing the same experience while doing so. With hundreds of cable channels and scores of websites and newgroups for every possible interest, lifestyle, and viewpoint, each person can now construct a 'community' of sorts that suits his pre-existing values, rather than negotiate these values with a geographically defined and confined community. One effect of this phenonmenon might be that individuals become more self-absorbed and less interested in even listening to the other side, since they have always at their fingertips an existing group who agrees with them. The less exchange there is between groups with different values and opinions, the more tenuous the link between citizens who do not share pre-existing agreement on their conceptions of the good life.  Another possible contributing cause may simply be that the quality of the media has reached a new nadir. Every generation no doubt critcizes its own popular culture when comparing it to some nostalgically conceived impression of popular culture that wasn't so crude and inane. But come on! What passes for news now is pure bullocks. The news media sounds so partisan that it reminds me of what I read about the Federalist and Jeffersonian pamphleteers from the early days of the Republic spewing invectives back and forth. On the right there is jingoistic and moralizing hysteria and on the left there is incoherent paranoid whining. Furthermore, whatever 'serious' news that do vie for our attention along with the Playstation, TiVO, and NASCAR fall into the categories of fear-mongering or cultural wars. It is no wonder that people new to America do not learn to appreciate the true value of American political culture, since this culture seems to manifest itself in only Great Debates over gay marriage and celebrity criminal trials.   So, maybe it's not that immigrants are no longer receptive to American political values, but rather that they took those values all too well to heart: Myself above all others, to hell with   your  beliefs, and entertainment for all!          \n",

      "              Last Day of Work   Got back from Atlanta last night so I could come in today to wrap things up at work, which amounts to piling a bunch of files into boxes and labeling the boxes... so pretty much like what I've been doing for the past month down South.   It is good to know that things are finishing up in Atlanta right now too; I'd hate to have left in the middle of it since that meant other people would have more to do. I've met some really nice people on this trip (and some not so nice... more on this later), and all in all it was a great way to wrap up my 8-month stint on the job. The dreaded Second Request wasn't so bad after all, at least not for those of us who don't have to   review  these documents; that's gotta be painful.  Another thing I've noticed from this trip in working with other firms is how down-to-earth our lawyers are compared to those from some of the big firms. There was one attorney who was perfectly nice and easy-going, but clearly came from serious money. Granted, the sum of my evidence for this claim is his sailing stories at dinner on Wednesday, but then again these were sailing stories set in Newport, RI and the Manhattan Yacht Club. Hmmm. Then there's the one lawyer from L.A. (figures) who brought her little Chihuahua to Atlanta in his own little monographed bag, and then to   dinner   with her firm. She apparently brings this dog to work with her back at the office too.   There was only one lawyer who was actually unpleasant. I don't want to say which firm, but it rhymes with 'Growel & Boring.' Maybe she was so nasty because she's Of Counsel and had to come pitch in at a document pull, something that is from what I can tell reserved for first year associates and peons like myself. But that doesn't excuse a generally rude demeanor and comments like 'I don't care about paralegals,' even in the context of joking with another (in-house) lawyer, and especially when there   is   a paralegal in the same room. To be fair, this little incident is pure hearsay to me, but I trust the source and the attibution to this one particular lawyer does not suprise me.   As for my job in New York, I'm glad to be done to be going back home. Though I know I'm going to have trouble disciplining myself, I'm going to try to spent the vast majority of my free time in May reading, writing, prepping for the GRE's, and excercising. I already have a couple of neat books that I'm aching to start, and a few others I really should finish. There's a strong temptation to go visit all sorts of people in the next month, but I really do want to try to reign in that urge and get some stuff done at home. Ask me how it went when June rolls around.          \n",

      "              Atlanta  I've been in Atlanta for work since last Thurday (with the weekend in between spent in Cambridge), and I should have been writing stuff all along, but have not had time. And it's a shame too, since being in a new environment makes for some good material. But, it's getting kind of late and I'm writing on the hotel's computer, so I'll just make a list of some thought I've had during the week in Powerpointese:  -  If you're ever travelling (-ling?) anywhere on someone else's dollar, stay at W Hotels. They are super-duper nice, if you can get over the whole dance-club/lounge style they've got going on.  - Despite being a fairly large and vibrant metropolis, Atlanta is still oh so very conservative compared to the North. I just noticed that the TV in the break area of the floor we're working on at the client site is always on Fox News. At first I thought people were just too lazy or didn't know how to change the channel; but it's only recently occurred to me that they actually   agree  with the nonsense spewed forth from the mouths of Fox's anchormen.  - NBA basketball is a lot slower in person. For some reason, the television makes the court look really large compared to the players, or it could be that you don't get a sense of how large the players really are on TV, but the court looks puny live. For context, I had really good searts to the Hawks-Sixers game last night, courtesy of the client, and for a meaningless game between two less-than-mediocre teams it was suprisingly competitive towards the end. The game was decided in overtime on the final shot, which was, albeit, a miss.  - There's a whole lot of gender segregation in the law business. And I guess this should come as no surprise to me, and I did notice it when I first started working at the firm I'm with now, but being here with two other much larger firms really highlights this point. Of the ten 12 support staff working on this matter between the three firms I am one of three guys, and the other two are both senior to the majority of the women, who make up the bulk of the peon-workforce, it seems. And I guess this makes sense in a twisted sort of way, since men are invariably more comfortable giving direction to women than to other men (except in a military setting, I suppose...).   - I've also noticed, now that I have some method of comparison, how efficient my firm is compared to some other, not-unprestigious places. They have a lot of expertise we don't, I think, but in terms of personnel, we have so many fewer inefficiencies, in part because we simply have fewer people, but also because we don't seem to have the kind of people who are really shirkers. This is particularly true when it comes to support staff, and I imagine at large firms it's almost always the case that some support workers get hammered with time, and other seem to get away with doing nothing most of the time; but I guess this is true in every kind of office. Somehow, though, the deadwood do things to try to seem useful, like wasting 45 minutes of everyone's time with a meeting spent drawing diagrams and coming up with acronyms for things like 'desk' and 'credenza' and 'rear desk.'   - I finished a short monograph on the work of Alistair MacIntyre, which actually helped a lot for my understanding of some of his major ideas. What I'm not so clear on, and on which I think the author did a poor job, was with both the criticism of MacIntyre work and the responses to them. I'd write something here to make this little tidbit at least somewhat useful, but I felt bad about writing comments in the margins of a library book, and so I forgot much of what I thought when I was reading it.  - It's really pretty tough to find good conversation even when one is surrounded by not-unintelligent people. The problem might be that a lot of people are relucant to have discussions that smack of intellecutualism because it comes off as pretentious, or for fear that it offends someone's political or religious or whatever sensibilities. Still, I'm looking forward to going back to school if just to have a forum where people can talk about ideas without worrying about these matters of manners as much.  Will write more stuff tomorrow, unless I go to the baseball game, gotta love the corporate seats.          \n",

      "              Road Trip and Wildlife   I'm en route to North Carolina (again) today, after having driven up to Cambridge from Long Island on Friday and then back down yesterday.   It's really nice to be in warm weather again, and I kept telling myself throughout this past winter that I will move to some warmer climate in the future. But the return of summer has also brought the return of bugs, and I do not react well immunologically to bug bites; specifically, I develop enormous, painful welts from the most ordinary of bites. So, I think I may have to reconsider the benefits of living in colder climates, where Nature in its parasitic glory isn't so prominent.  I'm starting to get a trickle of pictures in from my digital camera, so hopefully I will figure out how to post pictures online. I'm fairly certain that my ISP, Earthlink, has a reasonable amount of FTP storage space that I can use to link from this page.          \n",

      "              'Who Took My Flag?!'   I'm going to a wedding at the end of August; my first wedding ever, and it also happens to be my first lesbian wedding ever. It'll take place in a suburb of Boston, and it's of two middle-aged women who've been together for the past decade. They lived together for some years, although only one partner's name is on the deed of the house, and without marriage the other would not have any survivor's rights. Similarly, neither one can leave their jobs to explore other career opportunities because other cannot include her on a company health insurance plan. These material benefits, plus the psychological though perhaps more important benefits of recognition, will be available to them finally in just a few short weeks. Luckily for them, they are residents of Massachusetts. The countless other same-sex couples who wish to get married in their home state cannot do so, and, thanks to Governor Mitt Romney's decision to dig up an anti-miscegenation law from 1913, cannot do so in Massachusetts either. Never mind that the law's blindingly obvious intent was to enforce the martial Jim Crow laws of the southern states. Apparently this reprise of legislative hideousness doesn't phase the governor one bit.  The thing that surprises me about the zealousness of the opposition to same-sex marriage is exactly the lack of zealousness about   anything else   in most of its members. Were the entirety of the lobby made up of the staunch Christian Right, who are also vocally and politically pro-life, anti-death penalty, anti-divorce, anti-single parenting, anti-sex, and anti-puppies, then this whole thing would make sense. After all, it is understandable that some people have certain fundamental principles, no matter how unpleasant they may be, whose violation they will not tolerate. But the majority of Americans, thankfully, do not fall into this category. Sure, it seems likely that these days the majority of the country, or at least of the voting electorate, are leaning right instead of left. Yet there is a huge gap between people who are sympathetic to the (fruit)basket of conservative policies and those who would bring about political mayhem in all three branches of government, just to prevent ten percent of the population from using a word to describe their romantic relationships. (Polls consistently show that the majority of the country support full legal rights for same-sex civil unions, as long as those unions do not involve the word 'marriage').   What on earth makes this issue so important to so many in this country? What interest can heterosexual individuals possibly have in preventing their homosexual countrymen from marrying one another? The only interest that has been articulated, and I hesitate to use that word, is some half-baked notion about how same-sex marriages will erode the idea, and as a result, the practice of the 'traditional' family - presumably a husband, a wife, 2.5, 1.8 mistresses, a cat, a dog, and a  mortgage problem. But this argument is so nonsensical and inane that I find it hard to believe that people actually buy it. Yet it's understandable that people continue to spout it. One can hardly think of a more frightful impact than the dissolution of the American Family, and with it the end of procreation, because either everyone will 'turn gay,' or the children raised by weird non-traditional families will be dangerously antisocial anyway (because, alas, they won't have dad's alcoholic fits and mom's passive-aggressive sabotages from which to learn proper behavior). There is a certain percentage of the country that believes this story. In their minds, they have a real stake in this matter, because if they lose, then, well, the world might as well end. But they can't possibly make up the majority. There is also a large contingent of much more reasonable individuals out there who oppose same-sex marriage, even though they have no interest, so to speak, in that matter.  Why are these people, these slightly right of middle Americans, so opposed to a policy change than hurts no one and helps so many? Ariel made the interesting point that many of these individuals do in fact have a personal stake in preventing same-sex couples from the same kind of recognition afforded to heterosexuals. Were same-sex marriages to be recognized in this country, people quickly see that the world will not end as a result, and that homosexuals are different from heterosexuals in only superficial and politically and morally irrelevant ways. With this dawning realization, the still extant and often crushing stigma attached to being gay will slowly begin to lift. And then guess what happens? A whole lot of fathers, mothers, grandparents, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, cousins, daughters, and, gasp!, sons will begin to come out of the closet. An then won't it be humiliating for all those who now see homosexuality as at best something gross and weak, and at worse a mortal sin. So it is the fear of exposure, and the fear of the resulting embarrassment and ostracism that motivates those who have no other interest in opposing same-sex marriage to take their stance. This motive is much more base than those who motivate the true believers mentioned above. Those people do what they do because they believe it is a matter of right and wrong or life and death. These people are merely afraid of being shamed, in their own eyes and  in the eyes of their social cliques.  At first I thought that the fear motivation didn't make any sense, because it is a self-denying prophecy. If it came to be that same-sex marriages were recognized throughout the country, and homosexuality sheds all of its remaining social handicaps, then there would be nothing left to be embarrassed about even if one's son or mother finally comes out of the closet. In other words, the sequence of events leading to the negative result to happen necessitate the results to become no longer negative. But then it occurred to me that while this process may be true at the level of national popular sentiment, it is not true for each individuals. An interesting thing about major shifts in popular sentiment, especially those concerning taboo issues, is that people rarely think beforehand that they will be part of those who change their minds. As a result, people in the obstinate majority can't ever imagine that they (or people like them) will change their own minds, but they can very well imagine that other people (and isn't the 'liberal elite' the ultimate 'other' in American cultural politics?) will change their minds and bring about the catastrophic result. Hence the siege mentality, and hence the fervor in their opposition to same-sex marriage.   The couple whose wedding I am attending had for some time now an American flag with the rainbow colors hanging from the front of their house. A few nights ago, some people, kids presumably, stole the flag. It doesn't take a lengthy and rambling argument to explain their behavior. They were simply immature kids - jerks and bullies, who liked to pick on those who are different, and socially less powerful than they are. Maybe I've been thinking too hard about a rational explanation for the rabid and senseless bigotry against same-sex marriage. It could just be the case that the people who thoughtlessly oppose it just get a kick out of being bullies and jerks.   Don't we all want to be young again?          \n",

      "              Back from the Beach   I spent the last few days on the Outer Banks, in North Carolina, a very nice little area a few miles out in the Atlantic, full of summer homes and sand and stuff. I flew down on Monday after my GRE's.  The exam itself went pretty poorly. The test was much harder than any of the practice tests I did on both paper and computer from the GRE's own prep software. The issues essay topic was its usual banal statement; but the argument essay was pretty interesting, a mini-debate about environmental policy. The experimental section was a math section, that was super hard. The scored math section was more reasonable. The verbal was what did me in, the vocab itself wasn't hard in the sense of being words I'd never heard of, but rather just plain difficult in the logic between the words (in the case of analogies) and the specific usages (in the cases of antonyms). I guess this is the way they would ideally give the test, so that people are tested partially on their dictionary-understanding of vocabulary, but mostly on their ability to understand the use the words in their vocabulary, which I didn't do so well.   In any event, the test is over now, and the applications await. I can hope only that my writing scores will be good, because I scored much lower on the verbal than I did on the math, not so good when one is applying to a social science grad program. To be fair, the graduate admissions process bears barely a family resemblance to the undergraduate and law school processes. A high GRE, unlike a high LSAT, would not really help my chances. But I'm not certain that a low GRE won't   hurt   my chances. I should get the writing score in a week or so. Will revisit this subject on the blog at that point.           \n",

      "              This Post is Not Very Professional   'Two professionals in their 20s seek professional M or F roommate in his or her 20s for 3BR share.'  I remember seeing a bunch of ads like this when I looked for an apartment last year, and again when I looked to rent my place last month. As a matter a fact, I posted something very similar to that in my own   Craigslist  ad. It seemed that every other post used the word 'professional' to describe either the current inhabitants or the desired additions. But what exactly is a professional?  I always thought that, when used as a noun, professional refers to a person employed in, well, a profession. And it used to be that there were about as many recognized professions as you can count on your hand. There were the doctors, the engineers, the lawyers, the, uh... embalmers, and, well, the contract killers. In order to be a professional, you had to have been traded in these practices, went to some sort of school, and earned some kind of degree. Are teachers professionals? Traditionally I think they have been excluded, but I saw on the local news last night an interview at an elementary school with some woman whose title was 'paraprofessional.' The implication of this designation is that the teachers themselves are professionals. In any event, teachers are closer to the narrow definition of the term than investment bankers, consultants, and managers. But now it seems that in order to be a professional, you just need to be employed as anything higher up the workplace food chain than a corner spotter for the local crack deal (the crack dealer himself is, of course, a professional). So I guess we should probably call the spotter a paraprofessional.  Another use of the word that kind of strikes me happens in sentences like this one, 'Tie your shoes and get rid of that mustard stain on your shirt; you want to look professional.' I'm not sure if this is a sufficiency or necessity statement. Does having tied shoes make one a professional? Or does having untied shoes make one not a professional. Obviously what the statement is trying to communicate is the importance of looking like you're serious about whatever business situation your entering, so as not to give the other side the impression that they're dealing with some careless or dirty person. But I don't see why the word professional got impressed into the doing the shorthand work in this instance. What is needed is a word that conveys the meaning of looking like something within the broad range of 'impressive' to 'passable.'   After all, that is how we use it all the time now. 'Make this presentation look more professional.' (Translation: 'Make it prettier, with darker colors and fancy marble-patterned designs.') It's a PowerPoint presentation. You don't need professional training to make or understand powerpoint; and if you had it, you'd probably lose it from making mind-numbing slides anyway. 'You should act more professionally at meetings.' (Translation: 'Don't use non-standard English associated with ethnic minorities. Don't gesticulate like you're pistol-whipping someone. Wear a suit, preferably one without any logos on the lapels.')   I suppose the meaning of the word professional is well-understood enough, even if it is so vague as to approach meaninglessness. Still it kind of bothers me that so many people are encroaching on the word. I'm going to complain to my Member of Parliament, or maybe just write a letter to   Barbara Wallraff  and she what she says.           \n",

      "              Historical Materialism and the Long Island Rail Road   I don't even know what that title means, but I thought some Marxist jargon would be a good way to start off a post about economic and social injustice - sort of. I took the LIRR home today after picking up my visas from the Chinese consulate in New York (more on this in a bit). There was a little pamphlet on every seat which looks like it's some sort of newsletter from the railroad. On the back there is a little table called 'On-Time Monthly Performance,' showing the percentage of trains that run on time, defined as arriving within 6 minutes of the scheduled time, for each of the LIRR's 11 commuter lines.  Something about the table was interesting. The Port Washington line, which carries passengers to and from suburbs that can be categorized in the fairly well-off to very well-off range, ran on time 94.5 percent of the time. The Ronkonkoma line, which carries passengers to and from suburbs that can be categorized in the not-so-well-off range, arrived on time only 87.8 percent of the time. Now, in fairness, the Ronkonkoma line is a much longer line, so there are arguably more stops along the way at which delays could arise. But surely the railroad takes this factor into account when it builds the time table, and add in the buffer minutes accordingly. So I would guess that the delays are above and beyond the already budgeted delay times.   Still, Ronkonkoma is much father to go from New York than Port Washington. So I looked at the performance for the Montaulk line, which runs from Penn Station all the way out to the end of the southern fork of Long Island, much farther east then Ronkonkoma. It also happens that the Hamptons lie along the Montaulk line, so one can imagine the clientele for this service. Surprise, surprise, the Montaulk line arrived on time 94.03 percent of the time.   It seems that working class folks living en route to Ronkonkoma are 7 percent more likely to spend needless time waiting for the train than the upper-middle class folks living en route to Port Washington, or the super wealthy people playing en route to Montaulk. But that's ok, because those people's time are worth less anyway, so they might well spend it sitting in a train, or standing on an open-air platform in the middle of winter.   Now the Communists, for all they did wrong, at least they made the trains run on time. Wait, that's the what the Italians said of the fascists. But if there were trains delays under communism, at least they would be equal for all the people.  Speaking of the train to the Hamptons, the newsletter I found today also has a section about the special 'Hampton Reserve' trains that run during the summer. These are special Friday afternoon trains that, apparently, take reservations, and have attendants who 'serve[] beverages and snacks during your trip to the Hamptons/Montaulk.' I don't know if you've ever taken the LIRR, but I've never had an attendant serve me anything, except the occasional surely attitude (no, I'm kidding; they're all in fact exceptionally nice). But, I suppose if you have to suffer through a train ride to the Hamptons instead of a nice jet or chopper ride, you might as well have people wait on you during the trip.   Maybe if the people on the Ronkonkoma line had people serving them drinks and snacks, they wouldn't mind the extra delays.           \n",

      "              Rubbish in Real Time II  5 more days until the exam, and I want to do at least two more essays. So I'll start the clock on this one at 10:30AM.   Issue Essay: 'To truly understand your own culture - no matter how you define it - requires personal knowledge of at least one other culture, one that is distinctly different from your own.'   The term culture encompasses a set of values, rituals, and codes of behavior shared by a particular group of people. Within this group, these aspects make up one's entire life experience from birth to death, such that they become routine. Culture includes the language we speak and when and how it is spoken; it includes a set of religious or non-theistic ethical principles that governs our daily lives, and it includes the rules guiding all social interactions. We can practice our culture without being aware that there could be other ways of living our lives, since it could be the only thing we've ever known. Thus, in order for each person to truly understand his own culture, he needs to have personal knowledge of at least one other culture whose rituals, codes, and values are distinctly different from those of his own.  To understand something requires at the very least some knowledge about what that thing is, how it has come to be, and why it is that instead of something else. When applied to culture, understanding requires knowledge of a different culture in order to compare and contrast the basic elements of each. Without knowledge of another culture, we would not even know that ours is, in fact, a culture that is one of a set of many different and distinct cultures. Similarly, if we had no knowledge of other celestial bodies we would not know that the earth is but one of many objects in the universe, and thus not have an understanding of what the earth truly is.   Secondly, knowing another culture allows us to understand the origins of our own culture. Origins in this case does not mean the founding myths of a culture, which surely every one has. Rather, it means the historical conditions which gave rise to the parricular set of ideas, practices, and values that made up this culture instead of another one. For example, an island nation in tropics will likely have developed a different type of culture than a land-locked nation in the desert. In order to understand how one's own culture originated, one has to know about the origins of another culture in order to think about how differing conditions and circumstances impacted the development of each. It is only with this knowledge that culture are shaped by causal factors, and are not simply how things are naturally done, that we can understand our own culture.  Thirdly, and perhaps most important, one needs to know about another culture in order to appreciate what is valuable in his own culture. Without knowledge of how one's own culture could be different and what that experience might be like, one cannot really understand the experience of living in one's own culture. For example, a person growing up in a culture that values individualism and personal expression would not truly know why those two qualities of the culture are valuable, as that person has never experienced living in a culture that supressed or outright rejected those qualities. Knowledge of another culture's values and practices offers a different perspective from which one can learn to appreciate certain aspects of one's own culture. Conversely, knowledge of another culture's practices allows each person to see what might more preferable in that other culture. To reuse the earlier example, someone from an individualistic society might find beneficial the emphasis on social cooperation and mutual assistance in another culture. Knowledge of a different way of living life forms the impetus for us to change what we do not like in our own ways of living.   Lastly, the knowledge one has to have of another culture, unlike the knowledge one might have about other plants, needs to be personal knowledge. Personal knowledge is necessary for two reasons. First, we each experience our own culture in slightly different ways, so that it is crucial that we can compare our own interpretation of our culture with another. Thus the comparison requires personal knowledge. Second, the same observations of a different culture will result in different opinions and understandings in each different person. When we look through a telescope, we all see the same Juipter. Such is not the case when examining another culture. One cannot rely on someone else's knowledge of a different culture in order to compare and contrast, just as one cannot rely on someone's else's experience of one's own culture in order to do the same.  Culture and its component values, rituals, and codes of behavior guide almost every aspect of our lives. Since it is omnipresent in any given cultural group, one needs personal knowledge of another, distinct culture, in order to gain a prospective from which one can begin to understand one's own culture. It is through this knowledge of how life could be lived differently, that one can come to understand what it means to live life that way one does.   Argument Essay  The newsletter to investors contains one main conclusion based on two supporting conclusions. The main conclusion is that investors who own the stock should sell their shares of Old Dairy Industries, and that investors who do not own the stock should not buy it. This advice is based on two conclusions: first, that results of a recent survey reflect an actual trend that consumers will buy less high fat and cholesterol foods in favor of lower fat and cholesterol varieties; second, that as a result of this possible shift in behavior, Old Dairy Industries' profits will decline. The author's faulty analysis of the information given and his neglect of possible contradicting information both undermine the main conclusion of the argument.  The cited survey results indicate only what the surveyed consumers said they would do. The author does not indicate the source of the survey nor the selection process of the respondents. It could be the case that the survey was given as part of a medical research process examining patients with heart disease, in which case there would be a strong sample bias against high fat and cholesterol foods, and would not reflect what consumers in general want to do. Moreover, the survey results indicate only what the respondents said they would 'desire' to do, not what they actually have begun to do. There is no empirical evidence showing a downturn in the sales of high fat and high cholesterol foods, without which it is premature to believe that consumers will actually behave differently when they are shopping. Given these two analytical flaws, one should not conclude that the survey results are reflective of actual, broad-based consumer behavior.  The author's second supporting conclusion is also problematic. It infers from the questionable conclusion that consumers will buy less high fat and cholesterol foods to conclude that the sales and profits of Old Dairy Industries will 'diminish greatly,' because that company markets many products that are high in fat and cholesterol. However, before one can soundly make that inference, one needs several other pieces of information, which the author of the newsletter does not provide.  First, it is necessary to know whether or not Old Dairy Industries also markets other, low fat and cholesterol foods. If it does, then there is reason to believe that a shift in consumer behavior will not hurt, and will possibly help, the company's bottom line, since those who stop buying one product from the company will start buying another.   Second, there is no information whatsoever provided on what types of high fat and cholesterol foods the consumers will actually stop buying. Not all high fat and cholesterol foods are created equal. Some, like potato chips and other processed foods, provide no nutritional benefits and can probably be readily replaced in a person's diet. Others, like milk, are essential to many people's diets and will be more difficult to replace even if it contains high far and cholesterol. If the kinds of products that Old Dariy Industries markets are more like the latter kind, then even a general decline in the sales of high fat and cholesterol foods are unlikely to greatly impact this particular company's sales.  The newsletter's advice is that investors should sell and avoid stock in Old Dairy Industries. This advice, however, is given based on unsound conclusions drawn from sketchy data and faulty inferences. One should not conclude from an unnamed survey that the respondents' answer, in the absence of supporting data, will reflect general consumer behavior. Furthermore, one should not conclude that a shift in general consumer purchase patterns away from high far and cholesterol foods will hurt Old Dairy Industries. There is no information on the types of high fat and cholesterol products it makets, nor on what other types of products it markets. Both these factors could allow Old Dairy Industries to protect itself against, if not even profit from, a possible change in consumer purchasing behavior.           \n",

      "              Rubbish in Real Time   The GRE exam as of last year added a new section called 'analytical writing,' which includes an issues essay and an argument essay. The issues essay reminds me of the SAT II Writing essay component, where the exam makes some cliche and you're suppose to write about that somehow. Like, 'The squeaky wheel gets the grease,' or 'there are too many specialists in society today at the cost of more generalists.' The latter was the sample issue given by the GRE people. Since you're allowed to interpret the issue in any way, I thought about writing on how relievers in baseball are becoming too specialized to do one thing, like get some specific player out. But then I realized that was stupid. The argument essay sounds more interesting. That's where the exam presents certain facts and then draws a conclusion from these facts through a series of inferences, some valid, others not so much. We're suppose to write an essay assessing the strength of the argument, and I imagine that in 99.999% of the cases, the test-taker is suppose to attack the argument.   Since the exam is in exactly 7 days, I thought I should start writing some practice essays, even though I always hate doing that. Practice questions, I'll do a ton, but the essays are just so boring to write. So, to make the practice experience a bit more real for myself, I thought I'd write the on the blog, in real time, and post the results without any more editing than I would have at exam time (not that I ever edit any of the stuff that's on here).   So, it is now 1:05PM, I will begin my first essay when it hits 1:07.   Issue Essay: All students should be required to take courses in the sciences, even if they have no interest in science.   The purpose of an education is to impart knowledge on students that they should have, both so that they can function properly in society, and so they can appreciate the value and meaning of their own lives. Often times, this education will include subjects that at first appear esoteric and irrelevant to daily life, especially to younger children. Nonetheless, it is precisely when children are at that earlier age that they are most receptive to new knowledge, even if they do not realize or appreciate that at the time. Therefore, school curricula should focus on teaching what the students what is important regardless of the students professed interest in the topic. One such topic is the body of knowledge about the natural world collectively called the sciences: physics, chemistry, and biology. It is particularly important that students are educated in the sciences during elementary and high school. Once at the college level, students, if they have received a quality science eduationa already, should be allowed to choose their own classes. Although even at that level, there should be broad distributive categories, one of which needs to be science, and within which they need to take one or a few classes.  There are two main ways in which a science education is important and indeed essential for students. The first is in terms of the content they learn through such an education. This content itself can be divided into practical knowledge and aesthetic knowledge. Science is about understanding the world around us, but it can also be in certain cases about manipulating or controlling it. To build a car requires an understanding of physics and the interaction of forces; to invent medicine requires an understanding of human and molecular biology and the interaction of chemicals. All of technology, and the improvement is has on our lives, would be impossible within the basic science that grounds it. Just as science allows us to control our world, it also allows and compels us to protect it. Without an understanding of biology and geology among others, we would not appreciate the importance of preserving the environment around us, or even if we did, we would not know how to protect that environment. Thus, in order to continue to maintain and expand our practical and technological use of science, we should as a society ensure that our students are educated in those sciences.   Beyond its practical uses, the content of scientific knoweldge is also valuable in an aesthetic way. To know how the world works offers us not only the ability to shape it to our uses, but also to marvel at its beauty and elegance. The bulk of scientific research has always been directed at knowledge for its own sake rather than for ways we can exploit it for technological innovation. Students should be taught the sciences so that they can continue in this tradition, and so that they themselves can appreciate the wonders of our earth and of our universe.   The second main way in which a scientic education benefits students is how it shapes our practice of acquiring knowledge. Students in high school and particularly in elementary school are just beginning to learn how we learn things, and what is the proper way to learn things. The scientific method and its focus on evidence and logic impart and enforce lessons on learning itself. Without an education in the sciences, students will not know what it means for a fact to be true, and we risk losing them to superstituions and pseudo-science. Science also teaches students to think for themselves and no simply accept what others tell them as the truth. One of the main requirements of the scientific method is that all experiments be readily replicable, so that people can always go back and test any claim or theory. A science education teaches students how they can themsevles acquire and create knowledge for the rest of their lives.   Once students have graduated from high school with a solid grounding in the sciences, they should have some latitude in choosing their own courses in college. At the college level, most students have some idea of what it is they are interested in studying, and so the cost of extra classes in the sciences is time they do not have for other classes. Moreover, to force students to take many classes in sciences, particularly sciences in which they have no interest, encourages students not to take those classes seriously. However, some flexible distributive requirement should be in place that allows students to choose one science class from a variety. That way, students can take classes on what they want to continue to learn in college.   Argument Essay  The argument made by the author of the newspaper article is threefold: first, that the fitness level of the citizens of Corpora have actually gone down compared to that of tweny years ago; second, that computers are definitively not the cause of that downturn; and third, that the decline in the economy is most likely the cause. However, all three of the authors claims rest on faulty logic and questionable assumptions, and the state of the health of Coropora's citizens is likely much more complex.  First, the author uses the fact that only a quarter of the citizens meet the national advisory board's standard in physical fitness today compared to half of the population twenty years ago, we do not know if the standards used by the national advisory board is the same now as it was then. If in fact the standards have changed, then it is very possible that the citizens are just as fit today as they were tweny years ago, even though more of them no longer measure up to the news standards.  Second, the author draws a questionable inference from the fact the computer ownership level is highest where the fitness level is also highest to eliminate computer use as a possible cause of lower fitness levels. There could be other factors in the lives of those people that make them more fit than others. For example, ownership of computers suggests higher education and possibly higher income than non-ownership. Perhaps some other aspect  of the lifestyles of the segment of the population that has high computer ownership levels affect their fitness level. In that case, the amount of time spent in front of a computer can have direct impacts on one's fitness level., People have computers but not sufficient income will receive the negative effects of usage, and they would not have the means or time to exercise or eat well to counteract those effects.  Regardless of the relationship between computers and fitness, there is no reason to believe, as the author claims, that there is any relationship between the economy and spending on fitness products and services on the one hand, and the level of fitness in the population on the other hand. One's fitness is something that changes slowly over the course of years, and a decrease in spending on equipment or services for one year is unlikely to cause a large percentage of the population to become less healthy. Many types of fitness-related products are long lasting, like a pair of running shoes or a basketball, which are unlikely to be rendered useless by a temporary slump in the economy. Furthermore, the article mentions only that the fitness level this year is low, and not when it became this low. Thus, we do not know if the fitness level of the population changed during the downturn in the economy.  Finally, the author fails to consider several possible long-term changes that could have impacted the overall fitness-level of the population. The comparison is made, after all, between the level from tweny years ago and those from today. Much can change in the population in an entire generation. For example, we do not know if the economy of Corpora has changed dramatically from, say, an agricultural one to an industrial one. Such a change could certainly have a  negative impact on the fitness-level of Corpora's citizens. There could also have been changes in the population density, moving a less dense setting with space for exercise and better air quality to a more dense setting with less space and worse air. Changes in the daily habits of the population beyond computer-use are much more likely to affect that population's fitness level than temporary changes in the economy. If people started eating less healthy food or drove more to work instead of walked, the fitness level would decrease, and neither of these causes has much to do with the recent economic changes.          \n",

It seems that most of the hand full of people who look at this site do so in order to get the page to one of the bloggers in my links section - I'll let you guess who runs the most popular site here... - so in the interest of not deterring viewers I've put the links back.          \n",

      "              Book Review   I just finished Donald Antrim's novella,   Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World , and I quite liked it. The story is set over the course of a few days in what would seem like an ordinary suburb in some tropical coastal part of the United States. But readers quickly finds out that the town has descended into a Hobbesian chaos of fear and violence, started by what we learn was the ex-mayor's launching of should-held Stinger missiles in the park, which results in the death of several civilians and ultimately in the mayor's drawing and quartering by a fleet of mid-range sedans.   The rest of the story is equally saturated with violence, from neighborhood blood-feuds fought out in a land-mined park to lethal home defense systems surrounding every house. Yet, the mood of all of the characters in the story is probably best described as ordinary. The only problem that seems to bother people is the recent demise of the town school system, which the narrator, Pete Robinson, is trying to salvage in the form of a home school in his own house. Pete, a former history teacher with a fascination with medieval torture devices, oversees a grim disaster on the first day of classes in his new school, near the end of the book.  A very thin but omnipresent veneer of civility covers all the adult characters in the book. Despite the madness going on around them, the citizens of this town seem stuck in suburban bourgeois behavior and interaction modes. Though we are privy to the thoughts of only Pete Robinson, it is likely that the other adults share the same kind inner monologue that, though it does not ignore the reality, mold it into recognizable stories of causes and effects.   The children, on the other hand, adapt much more completely and openly to the new environment of a suburban jungle (and the jungle imagery appears repeatedly in the form of the no-man's-land of a park). An older child and former A-student Ben Weber devolves into Rambo-like warriors living only to avenge the death of his father, killed by the hated Benson clan. And Pete's best response to Ben's state is to invite him to guest teach at the new school on outdoor survival strategies. The younger children were, until the end of the book, sheltered from this reality in their own homes behind the moats and death pits. The irony is that it is with the opening of the brand new school, with all of its promise of teaching kids to make the town more civil (the mantra of the new school was 'Diversity, Tolerance!'), is what actually lead the kids to emulate the most horrific act of violence in the entire book.   I'm not sure what this book is commentary on, if it is a commentary on anything. Some reviewers on Amazon.com have expressed with displease that it is merely rehashing the by-now banal point that suburbia sucks. I don't think it's just about the effects of suburban life. The story would have been equally absurd and effective if it had taken place in an urban setting (indeed within a single apartment building). What is interesting is the sub-plot in the story that seems totally extraneous, namely the strange self-hypnosis technique that allow people to live briefly as if they were some kind of animal, an animal each person apparently just find himself to be. Most of the characters in the book are sea creatures; Pete seems to be the exception as a plains Buffalo. That, combined with the setting of the story (near the beach) and the constant physical reminders of the ocean (Pete's wife Meredith's shell necklace) surely have something to do with the social anarchy of the town. I don't know what this connection is. Maybe it's the author drawing a parallel between the return to primitive society in the town and the psychological return to existence as the most primitive organisms on earth, those that lived in the ocean. Who knows.   But regardless of its weirdness and possible depth (or maybe it's in spite of? or because of?), the book is a very comical if macabre read. And quick too, just the way I like 'em.  Speaking of a funny, macabre, and quick read, I would strongly recommend   Death and the Penguin , by Andrey Kurkov. This book is not so violent at all, and is a very charming and indeed sweet story about friendship... with a penguin, named Misha.           \n",

      "              Funny List     Harper's Magazine  has a collection of random funny media clippings each month in a section called 'Readings.' The June issue has a list taken from a post on armywives.com about the things you can do to feel like you were actually deployed on the Front. It is very, very funny, but I couldn't find the original posting on the web site, so I'll   link  to another blog whose author has taken the time to transcribe most of the list.  My favorite from the list:  'Go to the most crime-infested place you can find, heavily armed, wearing a flak jacket and a Kevlar helmet. Set up shop in a tent in a vacant lot. Announce to the residents that you are there to help them.  The rest of it list are clever but fairly mundane pokes at the various follies of military bureaucracy and at the harsh and often irrational inconveniences of life on the Front. But the one above makes it seem that the person who wrote it has a more fundamental problem with the overall mission in Iraq, and not just with ther operational stupidities of the military. The idea that an armed occupation is good for building civility and self sufficiency seems all the more ludicrous when reduced to the reality of entailing groups of armed men to stare warily at one another. I wonder who posted the list in the first place. Armywives.com itself looks like something cobbled together by, well, army wives. It's mood is, as one may expect, heavily patriotic. But it's good to know there is a healthy amount of dissent in the military caste.           \n",

      "              Let's All Go Out to the Movies   Just got back from seeing 'Troy' at the theatre nearest here, which is actually about 10 miles away. Overall I thought it was a good movie, kinda like 'Gladiator' in terms of production value and feel; but 'Gladiator' had a much stronger cast, I thought. The producers changed a great deal in adapting the screenplay from the  Iliad  , and instead of ending with the burial of Hector, the film ends with the fall of the eponymous city. I never read the Iliad, nor am I that familiar with the Greek stories, but I suspect that there are plenty of allusions that I didn't get throughout the film to works other writers who had chronicled the Trojan War. The one allusion I did get was towards the end, when Paris gives a sword to a teenager named Aeneas who is  escaping the city, and tells him to found a new Troy. So, people who know more than I do about classis will probably get a little more out of the film than I did.  Tonight was also the first time in a very long while that I've been to the movies on the weekend night, and the first time that I've ever done so in a suburban mall. I don't think I've ever seen so many high school students at the movies, or at anything else besides school; it was really quite a sight.   Also, the new template for this blog doesn't seem to be legible on my old PC with a pretty old version of Netscape, and I wonder if this problem happens on other computers. If it does, post a comment about it.     No More Raven Burgers for Me...?   Recent   research into animal cognition  suggests that some birds may have a more advanced 'theory of mind,' or knowledge of the existence of other minds, than we'd previously thought. This short Economist story summarizes the findings of two researchs' work on Ravens, including a test of the birds' ability to follow the gaze of a human, and their ability to learn to deceive one another.  I don't think this means that birds are now substantially smarter than we thought they were, and I do recall something from the behaviorist section of my Psych 1 class talking about some B.F. Skinner experiments from the 50's that showed birds learning to deceive each other. Apparently their success confirmed Skinner's theory that all of cognition and seemingly complex social beharior was really just conditioned rule-following, and that even birds can be conditioned to follow scaled-down but recognizable 'scripts' of human interaction.  I wished I'd paid more attention in that class.          \n",

      "              Three Pieces of Unrelated News   In general, I don't keep abreast of current events, and shamefully I try hard to keep it that way. News often depresses me. Not the kind of random murder-rape-and-rampage nonsense you get on the local news, but 'real' news about national and international political and economic developments. That kind of news depresses me even more, often because reading it just fills me with a sense of helplessness in a willfully unjust world. If you'll excuse the oxymoron, it feels like kind of a secular theodicy.  But, since I spent an hour and half upgrading my weblog last night, or about 75 minutes more than what it would have taken a gifted Rhesus monkey, I figured I'd post about three random tidbits in the news.   Imagine if you could double bill at *this* rate   Plaintiffs' counsel Townsend & Townsend & Crew (San Francisco) is   seeking   $258m in legal fees from Microsoft for their work in a settlement of a California class action suit against the software company. This proposed figure works out to $3,000 an hour billed for about 6,100 hours spent settling the case. The legal fees would be tacked on to the settlement figure of $1.1 billion. Other firms involved in the case are seeking fees up to $2,000 per hour for lawyers' time, and $1,000 per hour for support staff time.  Microsoft is arguing that these rates are excessive (the stingy bastards!). But plaintiffs' lawyers say that the rate is fair because of all the work that went into settling this case. Yes, I'm sure they worked very hard, and I'm sure every single one of those 6,100 hours was miserable and made every person who had to endure it wish for an early death (or more like for $3,000). And actually, I just browsed over to the firm's web page and clicked on some random lawyers' pages; and there apparently a ton of lawyers at this firm with doctorates - real ones, not J'D's. So I guess charging five-fold the customary rate per hour is justified because....    (a) these people have more student loans to pay back; 5 times more.  (b) (b)it's necessary to recoup the costs of putting all those extra letters behind people's names on business cards; and they cost 5 times as much.  (c) the cost of living in SF is *really* 5 times as high as everywhere else. Really.  (d) hookers and cocaine to celebrate the settlement; 5 times as many as usual  It'll be interesting to see what the judge rules on this. Actually, I take that back, it won't be in the least interesting. This is why I don't read the news. And this is why people hate lawyers.   The Sun is Going Out?   Strange but apparently true. A   story  in the Science Times about a trend in the last half century of decreasing sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. Scientists around the world have apparently noticed this phenomenon for some twenty years now, but it's been like the pink elephant in the room until now. Still, the magnitude and longevity of the trend is unclear, according to some people quoted in the article, and there is evidence that as air pollution has decreased in some parts of the world in the last decade, the amount of sun getting through has also increased. So it looks like we're not on our way to a slow nuclear winter, and that reversing our environmentally ruinous behavior does have appreciable impact on the economy.  Speaking of which, I decided to drive 2 blocks earlier today just to drop off some dry cleaning and buy a pack of index cards. But in my defense, the streets around here are practically uncrossable, since no one ever walks outside. The times were I do walk to the strip mall from the subdivision, I'm always the only pedestrian in sight.   Tom Delay   Is an asshole. This isn't really news per se, since it's pretty universally acknowledged. But I was reading something over the   AP  about a screening of new, even more graphic photos taken in Abu Ghraib prison. Delay was quoted saying that he thought that 'some people are overreacting' to the photos, and that 'the people who are against the war are using this to their political ends.' Interesting, that Mr. Delay would use this opportunity with the media to take a stab at his political opponents, castigation them for their callous use of such horrible material. I'd like to hear some Democrat or sane Republican come back and accuse Delay of being an opportunism, for exploiting the nature of these photos to get back at *his* opponents for *their* use, and so on, back and forth. Kind of like that episode of   Friends   where Joey and Chandler go back and forth pretending to be hurt by the other's joke about Joey missing his audition because of Chandler. It'd be great.  Anyhow, what's interesting to me is the way politicians say things like 'so and so is using issue x for political ends,' as if that ipso facto discredits that politician's position. In this particular instant, Delay seems to be saying that it's wrong to use an glaring example of the failure of the Administration's overall policy in this war to attack that policy. What is, after all, a political end? I can think of a couple possibilities here. 1. The end is to draw public attention to an issue important to the country. 2. It is to undermine the personalities within the Administration. 3. It is to garner support for some other issue that is important to the politician making the attacks. 4. It is for the personal aggrandizement of that politician.  Option 4 strikes me as unlikely in most cases (except Al Sharpton), and even if it were partially true for most people (I suspect it is) it strikes me as a acceptable price to pay if the platform of that politician is something worth supporting (like Al Sharpton). Option 1 seems like the ideal function of a political opposition in government. Option 2 would be a less than ideal function if those in power were otherwise decent leaders; but in the current situation, there needs to be personal accountability at at least the cabinet level for the magnitude of the mess in Iraq. Plus, when a scandal happens which, when examined in isolation and out of context seems not terribly serious (Watergate), can bring down truly awful executives, it is truly a virtue of the system. Option 3 is one that can and has been important to gather momentum for many important political changes, even though these changes may not be related to the scandal itself. For example, if by highlighting prison abuses, opposition politicians can mobilize public support for, say, closing the wealth gap, that would be totally great.  There is nothing wrong with using something that gets people's attention to draw that attention to important issues. This is how our minds work. When we see something that really sucks, there is a tendency, I think, to get into the mode of thinking 'this sucks, this ought to change or at least never happen again.' And once we start thinking that way about one thing, we start thinking that way about other, unrelated things, and we shed a general complacency that's been over this country for years, one that this Administration works very hard to keep over it. It is, however, wrong to take undeserved political credit for something, like Bush does in his 9/11 ads about ordinary people's heroic responses. That is 'using' an event for 'political ends' in the dirty, callous, and self-serving way.           \n",

      "              When Does It Stop?   I read this   essay  this morning in the Chronicle of Higher Education. It's written by an English (what else!) Professor about the endless competition of privileged students in high school, college, grad school, and finally in academe. The walk-away point is that academics all too often are where they are and do what they do because a deep-seated need for intellectual validation keeps driving them. Of course, many if not most professors simply love their work and the lifestyle that tenure provides. But I would not be surprised if the author's assertion is correct, that many people go on to grad schools, finish their dissertations, publish ceaselessly, and behave like pompous know-it-alls because those are ways to 'compensate[] for a perceived shortcoming.'  The author of the essay begins with a personal anecdote about competing to get into the best colleges while in high school. My high school class has its first reunion coming up in June, and this article made me think about the competition for college admissions that existed there.  I went to what by most accounts is a pretty good   high school . It was a laboratory school run by the City University of New York system, and accepted students at three different times, 30 for pre-Kindergarten, 30 more for First Grade, and about 200 in Seventh Grade. The graduating class size is usually somewhere around 200, since there are always some students who leave in ninth grade for another high school. I was one of the junior high kids, and I always believed that we were all part of the 'control' group for the experimental teaching methods they employed on the Elementary kids.   Unlike most schools of it caliber, mine did not charge tuition, and wasn't full of kids from the rarefied tiers of New York society. We were a mixed group; there were many children of professional parents, but probably more of teachers, government bureaucrats, and various other members of the petit bourgeoisie. I would also conservatively estimate that 15 to 20 percent of the students were first generation Americans or were themselves immigrants. The atmosphere was a competitive one, but not detrimentally so, not at least from my experience. Students unknowingly peer pressured one another to excel academically, but I've never know of any instances of sabotage or purposeful undermining of one student by another.   Still the atmosphere weighed heavily with academic over achievement, particularly when it came to the college admissions process. Every September the school newspaper publishes the colleges that the previous year's seniors attended, and the number that went to each. Although I don't have the numbers for my class, I remember that they were pretty consistent the with classes before me. Working from memory, I would estimate that a full third of my graduating class went to an Ivy League School, another 12-15 or so went to the other universities that made up the top ten of the U.S. News and World Report's from that year. Add to that another 10-12 that went to Swarthmore, Williams, and Amherst, the liberal-arts-college entente to the Harvard-Yale-Princeton axis. The other half of the class all went to a predictable list of colleges and universities in the top 50 of both categories listed in U.S. News, and less than a handful each year didn't go on to a four year program.   It wasn't until I reached college that these placement numbers became anything but ordinary. The cliche that many students enter Dartmouth as one of the smartest in their high school (possibly in many years) find themselves to be in the middle of the pack didn't at all apply to me. If anything, the cliche was inverted. Still, for three years of college I had little appreciation for the deep impact that high school left on my perception of relative academic accomplishment. To this day, I still tend to think of my going to Dartmouth as grudgingly accepting a silver metal (some days I think it's actually the bronze)  because I couldn't get the gold. But it was hard not to think this way when the chatter in the hallways was always about the HYP schools and how the other five were just the 'ghetto ivies,' (Brown is for intellectual light-weights, Dartmouth is for alcoholics, Cornell is mixed in with a bunch of state schools, Penn is so not-selective that it might as well be a state school, and Columbia is quasi-respectable only because it's in New York) or how one would have to be a total slacker to 'end up' in one of the State University of New York campuses.   It was more of a trophy-hunting attitude than anything else. One friend of mine went to Columbia, but that was ok because he turned down Caltech for quality-of-life reasons, so that partly mitigates his not getting into MIT. The only thing that prevented each of us from applying to thirty-something colleges (like they do at a lot of competitive high schools) was a cap imposed by the guidance counselors at 5 private schools per student.   I think this attitude stayed with me through my law school application process. I applied to 15 law schools in all. I told myself it was so I could hedge my bet, but in actuality it was totally senseless. Even the number of applications itself was decided on for worse than arbitrary reasons: I applied to one 'safety' outside of the top 15, and I didn't apply to #15 because it was in Texas, and because 16 isn't as nice a number as 15 (seriously!). In reality, it was very very unlikely that I would even consider going to more than half of the schools on the list. But I did it anyway in part out of fear, but also in part because I felt like each additional Top 15 school that accepted me somehow further proves my merit, just in case one or two acceptances were due to some kind of fluke or clerical error.   Sometimes I think that this kind of hollow competitiveness will end in law school. But now I worry that if anything it will get worse, because there are things like law review, and appellate clerkships, and then who knows, maybe the process will start all over again with graduate school applications and tenure-track job searches on law faculties. And then it never ends; it becomes publishing the most and in the best journals, attending conferences wearing the name of the most respected university in the field on one's name tag (and I hear from reliable sources that professors are particularly snobbish when it comes to those name tags). Once I've gotten used to defining success and failure based on these criteria, it is hard to switch to a different way of thinking about what accomplishments are meaningful in life - sure, *anyone* can have a loving family and be a pillar of the community, but you need a *degree* and $150,000 in student loans to do what I do... and so on and so forth.   And who knows what I'll do. But that's another question for another entry, probably prompted by another introspective rant from another professor on the Chronicle.          \n",

      "              Further Proof That Rupert Murdoch is Evil   I just read a very thoughtful   essay  from the Columbia Journalism Review by Brent Cunningham,   Across the Great Divide   . The authors writes about how print journalism has, over the past generation, increaingly lost touch with the working class and the poor in America. As the profession itself became more bourgeois, it has also gravitated to culturally and socially elitist views and interests, most notibly in the way it treats poverty as a one-dimensional problem, and how it all buy ignores truly working class Americans.  In telling this story, Cunningham helpfully makes a digression to define the terms 'working class,' contrasting it to what we normally think of as 'middle class' or 'capitalist class.' Class, according to economist Michael Zweig, ought properly be based on power and control over one's own economic well-being. However, we now tend to think of it as related exclusively to income, or to education, both of which though likely to impact one's class, hardly define it. Using Zweig's definition of class, we find that many more Americans are actually working class, some sixty-two percent of the workforce in fact.   And in fact most working adults do see themselves as working class, and respond as such when given the option in polls. But the national consciousness at the level of those who record (or arguably make) reality - namely, the press - still associates working class with the labor unions of the industrial age. The reality now is that the working class is composed of workers without unions and the benefits of union representation. They are instead powerless service workers with low skill jobs and even lower pay and non-existent benefit packages. It is this group that, according to Cunningham, most desperately needs and had traditionally receieved, the help of the press to publicize their concerns and tell their stories. Yet journalists today focus more on the extremes ends of the bell-curve of class in this country, the capitalist class and the poor (albeit in a problematic way).  Cunningham argues that changes in the profession of journalism, and in the journalists themselves, are largely responsible for this lacuna in the middle. Two related trends beginning in the 1960s are the corportization of the press and the professionalization of its journalists. Fewer and fewer journalists now come from working class backgrounds, and more and more voices in the press are under the control of 'corporate behemoths.' Cunningham notes that as recently as 1976, the   New York Post   made its 'last stab at bottom-up journalism' before being acquired by Rupert Murdoch. Journalists themselves started to become more homogenously members of the professional or capitalist classes, even while they became more 'superficially' diverse with the addition of women and racial minorities to the newsrooms.   The last third of the essay focuses on the problems in the way the press covers poverty and those living in it. But what interests me for the moment is why the press, particularly papers that have influence on the professional and capitalist classes, has shyed away from highlighting issues affecting so many working class Americans. What makes me think about this issue is the cover article in last month's   The Atlantic , an apologia by Howell Raines, the former Executive Editor at the New York   Times  , who was forced out after the Jayson Blair scandal.   One of his goals as the head of the   Times  , writes Raines, was to make the paper's weaker sections stronger so that the paper would appeal to more national readers who fit the demographic profiles of   Times   readers - i.e. the professionals and executives of America. The sections that Raines mentioned as the weakest were Business, Arts & Culture, and the Book Review, among other 'soft' sections. 'Soft' is, of course, thinly veiled code for sections, like Circuits, Travel, and the recently added Escapes, which appeal to people with plenty of discretionary income. Obviously, there is no reason to believe that strengthening these sections necessarily weakens sections that are relatively more in tune with the interests of the working class, such as the Metro Section. But what is important here is that the motivation behind Raines' moves is not the idea that it is essential for people to know about the best critic think about the latest opera at the Met, but that people   want   to know these things and they are looking elsewhere for that information when they should be looking at the   Times  . Readers are looking to the   Wall Street Journal   for news about the markets, to   New Yorker   for the arts, to the   New York Review of Books   for literature, to   USA Today   for Sports and rubbish about 'lifestyle.' In other words, what motivated Raines was not a committment to reporting what is important, but rather a concern for the bottom line of the New York Times Company. So much for 'All the News That's Fit to Print.'   The   Times   isn't really at fault, for it is just following the trend in order to survive as a business. Still, I am bothered by the pandering of the press to the interests of the wealthy. People rely on newspapers, particularly ones like the   Times  , to tell us what is actually important in our society and in the world, which all too often is not the same thing as what we want to know and want to read about. Raines writes in his article that he doesn't want people to pick up a newspaper with the attitude of 'I'm going to read this sonofabitch if it kills me!' but that attitude is far preferable to 'I'm going to read only things that I want to know and damn everything else!' I think I've written elsewhere on this blog about how media saturation and fragmentation has made it much easier for every one to filter out all information that does not relate to their own interest or confirm their own pre-existing beliefs. It would be sad if the press were no longer to act as the moral compass and motivator of the people with power in this country, but instead succomb to the their solipsistic self-indulgence.          \n",

      "              Slow Day   I just finished reading a few papers from a recent conference at Syracuse University on Citizenship, and will hopefully have something to write about soon(must get brain to work...). One thing right of the bat though, of the three papers I read, one was from a philospher, another from a political theorist, and a the third from a sociologist. While the first two are properly part of the humanities discipline, the last is at least in a name a social 'scientist.' So, one might expect that the prose of the scientist would be the most clear, jargon-free, and supported by empirical evidence. But what I found was the that philosopher and political theorist's essays were vastly more lucid than that of the sociologist, which was bogged down by jargon; poorly constructed, vague sentences; and hopelessly generalized and trite assertions. Here's a gem from the essay:        More broadly, the destabilizing of national state-centered hierarchies of       legitimate power and allegiances has enabled a multiplication of non-      formalized or only partly formalized political dynamics and actors. These      signal a deterritorializating of citizenship practices and identities, and of      discourses about loyalty and allegiance.  By the way, once I figured out what the hell these senteces mean, I also found that there was no evidence whatsoever to support these, as they turned out to be, rather outlandish statements.  Anyhow, here's a   story  that really tugs at the hear strings and shows how the little people always get screwed over by the (Swiss) Man. A federal jury recently ruled for Swiss Reinsurance, and against the developer of the World Trade Center, who sued to make the insurance company pay twice for the destruction of the towers because he claims they should be considered separate events. Swiss Re's victory is the latest in a series of law suits against a group of insurance companies that had insured the Trade Center, for a total worth of $3.5 billion. The developer (represented, incidently, by Wachtell) argued that the total should be doubled to $7 billion, but now it seems that he has to settle for the three and a half.   I suppose that one can look beyond the haggling over this monstrous event and think about the intellectual question of how we cognitively separate or conjoin events in our memories and in the stories we pass down through time. What defines the boundaries of one event: is it temporal or spatial? do we look at the consequences or the intent of the agents? But actually, I really just think this whole thing is kind of disgusting. Yes, I understand that life needs to go on and business needs to continue and that insurance exists so we can hedge against unimaginable events and that arriving at an efficient distribution of funds in the insurance settlement is best for the economy and so on and so forth. Still, the dirty part of this business is still bothersome for some reason that I can't fully articulate, especially because it seems that the lawyers involved in this case see it (as they do everything else) as a game between the two opposing counsels. These games involve huge sums of money, and the difference between winning and losing seems to be whether rich people become stinking rich or merely filthy rich - the presumption here is that to be stinking, one probably has to be   so   filthy as to start radiating an odor, but I welcome comments on my usage here.  Speaking of usage, I've never seen so many different ways of   calling someone stupid . The target, is of course, the president of these united states. But the novelty of this article is that, instead of being a 'well-meaning dolt,' Bush is actually someone who chose stupidity as a philosophy of life, thus making him far more dangerous (and also much less sympathetic) than the idealistic fool that even his supporters paint him to be.   And the voters still put him ahead in polls... Some day, someone is going to write a political treatise on the virue of the rule of the dumb; it'll be like a Plato's   Republic   for an idiocracy.          \n",

      "              How I Spent My Summer Vacation, Day 1: A Lesson in Statutory Interpretation  Note: I wrote all of the following down on paper last week, but haven't had a chance to post it. My life isn't that exciting, I'm just lazy.  I quit my job at the end of April so that I would have time to read, write, and study for the GRE's. With my job went my health insurance, and I'm not getting on the law school's health plan until August 1. For those in my position, the federal COBRA program is the simplest though most expensive way to continue on my old job's group plan. Essentially, I could opt to stay on that plan for a maximum duration of 18 months, but I would be paying the cost of the premium in its entirety, or some $468.59, or approximately Much More Than I Could Dream of Affording.  Fortunately, or so I'd thought, there is a state mandate in New York called Healthy NY, which provides subsidized health insurance through private HMOs to the working poor. At first I didn't think I'd qualify, since I'm no longer working, but one is also eligible for the program if one has lost one's health insurance for any of a list of acceptable reasons as long as one has worked within the last twelve months. The two reasons that concerned my case were (1) 'Loss of Employment,' and (2) 'Termination or Cancelation of COBRA' coverage. I thought that I would qualify for Healthy NY since I am no longer working, I have, in sense, 'lost' my employment. Just to make sure, I called Aetna before quitting and explained my situation to see if I'd qualify. A very nice but obviously clueless man over the phone said that I would be covered. It seemed that I'd won the day.  I called Aetna on Monday to sign up for the program, only to find out that it and every other HMO decided to narrowly interpret 'loss of employment' as exluding voluntarily leaving one's job, even though no such condition is specified on the New York State application form for Healthy NY.  This interpretation along with the text strikes me as horribly misleading. Plenty of people leave their jobs all the time for reasons much more compelling than my own, including those who do so in cases of 'constructive discharge.' It seems to me that if one is not working, for whatever reason, one should be able to buy into a group plan, especially since the program has a proviso stating that one must have had a job within the last twelve months, so people can't just stay on state-subsidized health care forever (because if we ever did that, then the terrorists would have won).   But I'd also read somewhere that the first test of statutory interpretation is to look at the 'plain meaning' of the text. Supposing that there is such a thing as plain meaning, I guess that I'm not exactly eligible under the loss of employment criteria, since I didn't so much lose my job as bring it back to the store with a gift receipt. It also makes sense that the text would not make me eligible, since the program seems intended for people who lost their own health insurance through acts not of their own volition, like getting fired or laid off.  The other eligibility criterion that applies to me (sort of) is the Termination/Cancelation of COBRA. Here is where it gets interesting. The only way that COBRA can terminate is if it were to run out after the elapse of the 18-month period. The only way to cancel it is if one does so oneself. This is an interesting point, because now it seems that onecan qualify for Healthy NY even if the qualifying event was something of one's own choosing, namely deciding to cancel one's own COBRA coverage. But if I can choose to end COBRA (for whatever reason, it's too expensive, I don't like my HMO, etc.) and go on Healthy NY, why can't I choose to leave my job and do the same?  I posed this question to the customer service people and a few supervisors at the various HMO's I'd spent all morning calling. Not surprisingly, I didn't get a good answer out of any of them. The best answer was from one supervisor at I think CIGNA, who said that Healthy NY covers people who can't afford their own COBRA coverage. 'Ah ha!' I said, so it shouldn't matter   how   it came to be that I am no longer employed, only that I can no longer afford to COBRA myself; and since I can't afford it, I should be eligible, right? Wrong. The criterion states 'termination or cancelation,' and since I was never on COBRA to begin with, I can't make myself qualify by canceling it. 'You can't cancel something you were never on in the first place,' the supervisor avered in a triumphant exercise of verbal reasoning.   That's   why she's the supervisor!  And, considering the plain meaning of the text, she's right too. If the qualifying event is the ending of COBRA per se, then I don't qualify, even if the reason I can't end COBRA is that I can't afford to get on it in the first instance. But that doesn't seem to matter before the sovereign power of Plain Meaning. Nor does it matter that the very existence of the cancelation criterion betrays the program's intent to cover those without the means to go on COBRA.  None of this seemed right to me, so I called the Healthy NY telephone line, which, not surprisingly, was unmanned. Next, I tried to call the New York State Insurance Department's complaints and consumer services division. The voice that picked up announced itself to be a test greeting message, and then hung up on me.  After five hours of trying to find a way to cover myself for the summer, I finally settled on an acceptable if more expensive solution: I would COBRA myself for the month of way, with the intent of canceling by June 1, so that I could apply during May to begin Healthy NY starting June 1. Only one more obstacle lied in the way. In order to get Healthy NY for a given month, one needs to apply before the 20th of the preceding month. The problem is that by the time my COBRA for May ends, it'll be too late to apply for Healthy NY for June. I was told by an HMO that my best bet is to explain in writing that my COBRA was ending at the end of May. Along with this letter I should include a letter from my employer stating that I'm no longer with the firm, a W-2 form to prove that I had been working there within the last twelve months, my driver's licence to prove residency in New York (my license expired on Friday, when they most likely received the application, so I think I have much more fun to come with this), 3 dead frogs, and a picture of the Crown Jewels of the House of Windsor (photocopies acceptable). All this, and I'm still not an inch closer to proving that I currently am not working at all. Amazingly, some guy from Empire Blue Cross actually asked me to demonstrate my unemployed status. How am I suppose to prove something negative? That's why   this   guy isn't a supervisor.  I think some people, Republicans come to mind, would use my tale as a caution against state subsidies for affordable private health insurance, pointing to the various bureaucratic hoops and the inevitable growth of government to facilitate this program. Actually, as I learned, there is no one working at Healthy NY, or none answering the phones anyway, so we won't have to worry about bigger government. The reason my experience has been a mess is precisely because we don't have universal health insurance, whether it is state of federally funded. If we'd had that, I wouldn't have to conduct graduate-level research just to find a new provider every time I switch jobs, or worry about taking a job because it has a such-and-such deductible in their plan with only so-and-so many doctors in their HMO network. Nor, for that matter, would I need to worry about textual analysis or speculate on the legislators' intent because I wouldn't need to fill out application forms for temporary coverage.  But no, that would be too complaiced and economically inefficient (and, lest we forget, the terrorists would win). Instead, relatively healthy people like me, who've taken out less from their insurance in their lifetimes than they'd put in in one month, should be spending hours just to figure out the paperwork. The people with actual health problems, they should spend hundreds of hours litigating their claims to get their HMOs along with Medicare, Medicaid, Medigap, Medi-dee and Medi-dumb to pay up. As for the people without health insurance altogether because they don't have the JD training to figure out the arcane system, they're probably better off pouring Robitussin over their injuries anyhow.           \n",

      "              Truly One of the Worst Ideas I've Ever Had  I decided a few months back that instead of going to Europe two days early and instead of being with Ariel for those extra two days, I would go back up to school for commencement. This decision is, without a doubt, the single stupidest act of social-time management I have ever made. I knew then, as I know now, that this will most likely be the last time I'll be back on campus for a long time to come; I also know that this is a rare chance to see a professor or two that I otherwise would not have. But it simply wasn't worth the effort, expense, and most importantly opportunity cost to do so. I guess it was false sentimentality that led me to plan it this way all the way back in December. But even as early as February, the last time I was here, I'd began to suspect that I wouldn't enjoy visiting as much as I'd thought I would. Sadly, I suppose, there just isn't a whole lot for me to to come back to, and it took this trip for me to fully awaken to that.   I wish I were somewhere else, right now.          \n",

      "              Biting the Hand That Feeds You  An   article  this morning about Venetians complaining that tourism is destroying their city. The comments from locals invariably compare the tourists, mostly Germans from my experience, to all forms of barbarians and invaders. But rarely do invaders account for 70% of a city's economy. There are definite downsides to such reliance on tourism, sure, such as the lack of small business services geared towards long-term residents (like a supermarket). Yet given Venice's crumbling infrastructure, it's unlikely that the city would be better off trying to attract another industry as a source of income - the entire place is built on rotting wooden beams. It's unfortunate that a whole city is becoming a museum amusement park, and now the mayor is trying to lure businesses back with the argument 'if you have to spend 10 hours a day in front of a computer screen, you might as well do it here.'    Incidently...  the ad on the top of the page with the Venice article was from   Emirates Airlines , the luxury airliner based on Dubai. I don't want to presume that they do most of their business with people in or connected with the oil industry, but it's anybody's guess why else a tiny Gulf country living purely off oil would need with a large luxury commercial fleet. Anyway, the thing that struck me both in the ad and on the company's homepage is that the picture of the flight attendants. They're all of gorgeous, radiantly pale blonde women. Just to be sure, I checked with the   World Factbook , and there is in fact no large Norwegian diaspora in the United Arab Emirates - although 8% of the population is made of Caucasians and East Asian expats, so maybe all of them work as flight attendants.   Generally, it seems that airlines tend to hire people from their home base countries. With the Emirates this is probably impossible, since first, there might be serious social prohibitions against their own women working, particularly jobs like this, and second, no one who is a citizen of that country needs work a day in his life in service jobs, since the state provides for everyone cradle-to-grave with government oil revenue. So, the airline needs to staff the cabins with women form somewhere, but not their own. The next best option, I guess, is to look who your passengers are likely to be, and then find attendants that look like   them  . This is probably how they arrived at the decision to staff up with Ingrid Bergmanns (or at least present the image of doing so).   Still, it's a bit weird, because the flight attendants all weird a head-dress that I can guess only is somehow related to the UAE, for they're certainly not Western. This suggests that the company isn't out to make their staff look entirely like their customers, and that is still wants to present some sort of Emirate characters for the airline itself. Why then, would you choose the puzzling combination of having a Barbie be the face of your airline, yet dress her up in some sort of traditional national costume? (It's Desert Barbie!) There is, I think, a much more cynical interpretation to this choice, but I'm not going to write about that.          \n",

      "              Bush Can Torture You   I just read   this story  on the   Times  , about a Justice Department memorandum from March, arguing that the Administration is not bound by either international treaties banning torture, or by domestic federal law prohibiting it. The memo, commissioned by Rumsfeld (there's a surprise), argued that torture is legal if it is approved by the President in his capacity as commander-in-chief (but not in his capacity as nitwit-in-chief), because he has the authority to wield any technique that would protect national security.   Curiously enough, the lawyers also argue that military personnel would be immune from international and domestic laws against torture if there were acting under superior orders,   'except where the conduct goes so far as to be patently unlawful.'   Hang on a minute. That statement seems a bit odd. How can any action appear patently unlawful (or 'manifestly illegal,' as I think the concept is usually called) to a soldier if all actions authorized by the President is ipso facto legal? The 'exception' in this case seems to refer to an empty set of circumstances, since no action will be patently illegal if the order originated from the President, or, more likely, from the Defense Secretary.  Another argument in the memo is that military personnel can torture people if they believe that such actions are necessary to avoid a greater harm. I don't have any idea what the necessity doctrine (if there is in fact such a thing) specifies, but the name itself suggests that it is a dubious justification for torture. The reasoning behind the necessity claim seems to be that, if one can avoid a greater harm   only   by torturing someone, then it is justified to do so. Torture is 'necessary' because it is the only (not simply easiest) way to avoid a greater harm. But it seems that there should also be the requirement that the torture must very likely enable the torturers to avoid that greater harm, and that this bar for likelihood be set very high. In other words, the information gathered from torture must be sufficient, when combined with other actions, to allow the state to prevent some harmful action. If there are other factors that make such an effective intervention unlikely, and there is always a myriad of other factors, then torture doesn't seem justifiable because it does not produce the only justifying result, namely the prevention of harm. For example, if by torturing some prisoner, the army can obtain detailed plans for some specific attack, including information that would enable it to stop the attack, then the necessity doctrine would be satisfied. Whether that is sufficient to justify torture is, mind you, a whole separate issue. But I don't believe that the necessity doctrine can even be properly invoked in the vast majority of realistic situations, if ever.  Not surprisingly, State Department lawyers dissented from the views of the DOJ. What is interesting is that lawyers representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff also disagreed with the arguments of the memorandum. Surely this is because the dissenting bodies have their own people at risk if other countries decide to follow the US's lead and start torturing captured Americans based on the authorizations of their respective village idiots. Neither DOJ nor DOD have its own people directly exposed to such dangers, so why should they care if other states start reciprocating? People like Wolfowitz and Feith and Perle and Carbone have the comfort and security of being far far away, both in terms of their persons and their bureaus, from the reality of war and torture. All of this is an academic exercise for them, a matter of assessing which 'technique' produces the most effective results.   I imagine that somewhere, right now, a bunch of lawyers are working to oppose to new interpretation of the Administration regarding torture, and are preparing to challenge that in court at the first opportune moment. Hopefully the courts will listen to reason, and this interpretation will be ruled illegal. Otherwise, the Administration might start torturing these lawyers, because, well, it is necessary that they stop their work preventing torture, so that the state can torture other people who might have information, so that it can maybe enhance national security.           \n",

      "              When the Tenure Track REALLY Gets Unbearable   TBS and the creator of 'The Bachelor' are producing a   reality version of Gilligan's Island . The premise seems to be that 7 people who are real life versions of the characters in the original show will be castaways on a desert island, and their task is to try to get off the that island. The show is now casting for a real skipper (preferably fat and quick tempered), a real first mate (preferably stringy and goofy), a real couple of elderly millionaires (preferably WASPy - though let's face it, they'll all be WASPy), a real movie start, a real Kansas Farm girl, and a real professor.  It was unclear what kind of professor the Professor was on the show. I suspect some kind of engineering or physical science. The only thing more ludicrous than building a radio and telephone out of coconuts is the idea that a literary theorist or ancient Chinese art historian is the on doing it. What is neat to me is that the show portrayed a professor as not merely a learned scholar, but also a virtuoso in functional know-how. How alien that image seems now (and probably did then, for all I know about the times). Professors these days are more commonly thought of as recluses who spend time and money studying specialties that are recondite at best, and criminally pointless at worst. I wonder what kind of a professor they'll ultimately cast for the role on this show.   For that matter, what kind of 'movie star' would do a show like this, on TBS no less? In order for the person to be credible as Ginger, she has to really be a movie star, but I never really knew what caliber a 'star' Ginger was. Presumably one does not need million-dollar contracts or Oscar nominations in order to be called a movie star, but would a dozen lines in some poorly reviewed, limited release B-movie be enough?  Also, the idea of the millionaire husband and wife team seems doomed to fail in the reality series (that is, fail more spectacularly than the rest of the show). The whole gimmick of the Howells in the original series was that here are these two stuffy snobs sent careening out of their element, and we're there to watch the hilarity ensue as they haplessly try to adapt to their new situation. After all, the show wouldn't have been nearly as funny if it'd been about a bunch of sailors marooned on an island. Millionaires per se are not hard to find in this country, and probably not that difficult to cast. But millionaires like the Howells would, I think, be impossible to find for the show, because nobody like that would ever do a show like this, and if they did, then their credibility as the stuffy rich guy is instantly destroyed. It's no fun to watch a millionaire struggle if he is pretty much like everyone else, only with more money.  Anyhow, that was way too much thought spent on this show.          \n",

      "              Some Updates   I spent the last week or so in Durham, North Carolina. On Thursday night I went to a Durham Bulls Triple-A baseball game. The ballpark was quite nice, and from the looks of it pretty new too. We sat right behind homeplate on the first base side, and had a good view of the field and the Durham skyline. The largest building in view beyond the park was the Durham county jail, a structure that was at least tweny stories high and occupied an entire city block. It was, incidently, right across the street from the ballpark. It showed up in all of my pictures from the game.   Now why would someone build a baseball park right across the street from a jail? Or, conversely, why would the city put a huge jail right across the street from what is probably the largest and most attractive civic builing in the entire city?  Also, planning for the summer trip is proceeding apace. I just spent a few moments on the phone with a woman at a hotel in Annecy, France, and realized at all the Hollywood renditions of french accents are completely accurate. Either that, or when French people learn English as a second language they learn with the inflection of Hollywood Franglais. You'd figure that people in the hotel industry, especially one that caters to foreign tourists (as oppose to, say, businesses with French contacts), and she did, though with curious vocabulary gaps, like the english word 'thirty.' (The french is 'trent'? what about french for 'first,' as in 'first of July'...?)  I'm always impressed by people who are verbally multilingual, even if it is for limited busines purposes. I had trouble with foreign language classes in school, particularly with the spoken aspects, because I am always so self conscious of my pronounciation. The dread of sounding foolish makes me not want to speak at all, even if i'm in a group of people whose spoken whathaveyou is equally hideous.          \n",

      "              Someone Who Understands Macroeconomics Please Help Me   The market price for a   hostel   room in the capital of Iceland (I can't spell it right now) is $50 per person per night. In other words, a single room for two people per night in one of these glorified homeless shelters costs about as much as a room at a reasonable hotel in almost any city in the United States. So everything is really expensive in Iceland. That makes sense. Consumable natural resources are pretty scarce, and external trade is very costly. This is all intuitive. What I don't understand is how the people there manage such a high standard of living. It seems that if an entire national economy is grounded on such harsh conditions, then things should be expensive but people should be poor. The alternative is that the people are very productive and make all sorts of stuff that they can export for other products and services that thery can't produce at home. The example I'm thinking of is Japan. Stuff there is exoribtantly expensive, and the people there have very high standards of living. But this makes sense to me because Japan is a insanely productive country. What on earth does Iceland produce them that allows them to afford a high standard of living while still making things so expensive???          \n",

      "           L.O.V.E.  what did u think it was? ;op  it's one of the most difficult word to apply, i realise.   things appear so wonderful when u are falling in love with a guy whom u think is the best on earth. the birds sing (not chirping irritably), the flowers bloom (not attracting bees and scaring people) and food taste better (even those canteens in industrial areas).  your heart skips many a beat when you see HIM. your breath quickens and you start talking in a giggly voice. you tell HIM little things (there's a cockroach in the office today!) and you do little things for HIM (sending him inspiring quotes everyday).  then as u embark on a journey of discovery... clouds of doubt start hovering over. why doesn't HE do this or that? why does He do this or that? why does HE behaves like this or that? am i bothering HIM with all the silly things i have done? am i irritating? if not, why doesn't HE reciprocate or show some indication at all? does HE really like me, let alone LOVE me? is this a mistake? Maybe, just maybe, the relationship was never meant to be in the beginning.  birds wake u up early in the morning chirping irritatingly (don't u wish to just shoot them off the tree). bees buzz dangerously close to u as they fly around the flowers in the garden (insecticide pls). and food is just tasteless, if lucky. else it's shit on ur plate (will someone do everybody a favour and fire the chef).  perhaps it is time to let go when ur consciousness are all about the pain and tears start flowing. it was good while it lasted. but another question pop up: who should decide the time to end it? how 'long' is it 'good' enough?  my 1st lesson in love taught me not to think so much, what counts is the happiness at that present moment. I applied it and found out that it is not totally true; the bitter aftereffect that follows the end of the relationship can be just as intense, if not more.  so my 2nd lesson learnt: consequences of being in or not in love cannot be belittled. one can have the pleasurable experience while in love at that moment, and will also have the painful ordeal of surviving the lost of love. cos eventually u are the one who is going to live with ur decision made that time and its repercussion.     after these lessons, i am starting to think, maybe it's better to continue liking a person than to start something with HIM if the relationship was never meant to work out. the best impression of the person remains in memory.   of course, u are happy when u are with HIM, in a love relationship. all the things done together become the beautiful memories which are so precious. but it is these treasures tucked away at the back of the head that will make it harder to let go. cos u have put so much into it, that u just can't say goodbye.  not now, not yet.  maybe things will change for the better. maybe we can work something out. but when it doesn't, it turns ugly. what u will remember of the relationship will be the nasty stuff, not the good ones.   wise old saying: it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved  my saying: it's an easier option to fall in love with someone you like than choosing to NOT fall in love with HIM. but the consequences are for u to bear, so u better think bloody 10x about that so u won't end up shooting birds early in the morning.          \n",

Of course enjoyed the time out with people i love and those who love me very much. It's really these times that will be engraved onto the memory and be replayed when i am alone in Brazil.  Relatives - 2 sub-categories. Group A consists of very close relatives. Group B is, well, those you won't even want to hang out with to get Ang Pao for Chinese New Year. But due to the circumstances i am in, i have to meet both of them. like it or not.    As for the last category... it was rather paiseh to reject when people want to meet you. it's an honor to be desired! tho' sometimes may feel that it's a chore and a waste of precious time. but you never know when your paths will cross again, so better keep that connection open ;op  then there are also those whom you like to meet after losing touch for a long time but when you really catch up, you realise that you have nothing to say to each other. it's really sad when it happens, cos you will expect the dinner to go smoothly, filled with laughter and gossipy updates, only to be disappointed with silence over the meal.  Was rather heavy hearted, to realise that some ppl will really make time out to meet you up. even for a quick meal or so, while others, usually ones that you cherish, doesn't really bother about you or the fact that you are leaving in less than 3 weeks' time.

      "           17 more days to go.   been out with frens and spending as much time at home as possible. the jabs been making me feel very tired. i took a total of 4 jabs - 3 on thursday (tetanus, hep A, Typhoid) and 1 on friday (Rabies, 1st shot out of 3).  talked to the manager i will be reporting to in Brazil, he came back to endorse his visa. My queries have more or less been answered:  Internet Access - Will apply for me, so should not be a problem  Accomodation - Will stay with another girl temporary, until we have found the new location to move into. Yes, single. Me, Myself and I.  Telephone - Very expensive to call back. Looks like i have to rely on internet then. Company will provide a local mobile phone. hehe. You guys in SG can still con't sms-ing or calling me on my SG mobile since i have decided to apply autoroaming. but i will have to pay the bucks.   Food - Yes yes... trying to incorporate meat into my diet now. but if there are much veggie or grass to be grazed, i might just go back to being veggie! the servings usually go by kg, and for a simple lunch will cost abt SG$7-8. Good resturants will cost abt SG$30 ($1 Reais = $0.6 SG) or more. I will try cooking. probably will lose another 10 kg from the lack of nourishing and edible food (my cooking).  Clothes - Office wear similar to SG. so it's casual + smart. and during the weekends, dress shorts and t-shirt. no fancy orchard-road fashion show here...   Climate - Brazil is in the same latitude as in Aussie. so now it's winter. it won't get lower than 15Deg in the day, and 12Deg in the night. and i am staying near the coast, so it will not be that bad.   Safety - will be travelling together with my colleagues to and fro work as we have a car sharing system. no pepper spray needed.. apparently not that bad. but will be mindful.  Well, looks like it's pretty much on my own now... Pls give me strength. HIKES!          \n",

The universal answer was given: 'Don't know but try 1st lah'   hahhaha. i dunno to laugh or cry.   it's like i am so scared of leaving my family and friends, and slowly psychoing myself that it'll be ok. i will survive and it'll be a great experience in exchange for home-sickness blah blah. and now i may end up not going at all, let alone say leaving on time!  amazing how this big company works. simply astonishing.           \n",

We reach Paris in the morning at abt 7am. checked into a day hotel (Euro 89 for that few hours!!!!) and went to Eiffel Tower. my 2 idiotic colleagues think they could just ask around in the sub way station while i thot they knew the way... so i went back and ask the receptionist. anyway french are snobbish assholes who think that French is the best language so if u speak english ' sorry i don't understand you' urgh! but we were lucky to bump into an old couple who were going in that direction and we figured out the way to get there altogether. after the effiel tower trip we went back to hotel in taxi (no train. won~t be able to make it for teh plane if we did!) i was napping and when i woke up, my legs were so jelly that i fell on the carpet and scratch myself!!!! my knee bled! hahahahhaaa.. was too tired on the 13 hour flight.   then another 12 uneventful hours and we reached Rio at 630, 2 of us stay at 2 different apt in Rio city while the other colleague went to our yard 3 hours away. went shopping with 3 uncles and at nite attended a party. the brazilian gals are BEAUTIFUL with GREAT bodies. now i am thinking, i won~t be able to achieve my goal: to find a boyfriend here... sob sob...  sunday went to another town, where our yard is based at. the aptments where one of the colleague is staying face the BLUE sea. oh my goodness. it~s really 'got money also can't buy'. really really beautiful but out of the way. it's almost a 3 hour drive to town  my apt is great too, facing the famous sugar loaf cliff and the jesus christ statue. really FACING. but next to us are slums... and last nite i heard gun shots for teh 1st time. the nite is lited up by the slums located in the hills... the city is so beautiful with the colourful stars. but it's ironic that the nite beauty of brazil is shone by the poorest.   today 1st day of work. already anticipating lots of things to come my way. will show u all the pics next time, i loaded into my laptop.   AND DID I MENTION THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE SO CUTE! THERE' S THIS GUY I BE WORKING WITH ON A PROJECT WHO LOOKS LIKE THE CLARKE KEN SUPERMAN?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(and the owners cat is sooooooooo cute!)  The topic on Affairs of the heart came up. South Americans are known to be more passionate and possessive. Melissa, a local colleague said she thinks that passion can come and go, but not love. She believes that one can rekindle the passion that is gone. I argued: how would u know the passion will come back once it is gone. Its the same issue as how would you know when to let go of a relationship when its stale? Guess you just know it.  My input is that Asians tend to have passion only in courtship. Once family is set up, the passion is taken over by commitment to feed the family. Isnt it true. Till now I have only seen a few cases where the passion is shown to each other, where love is for only each other and commitment is to stay with him/ her even with temptations around.   Gaffore said lust and love are inter-related. (somehow he always gives me the creeps. Especially now that he say this yew!)  Melissa is with a guy for more than 3 years and they hardly see each other except during the weekend. So I asked what is passion? its looking at that person and you go WOW, shes gorgeous.   I wonder, really, if anyone of my friends is that blissfully in love, in passion and in commitment. I will be truly happy (and envious, to be frank) for him/ her, and for myself too  because I will be convinced that such relationship exist not only in the Samba country. Maybe I will not be that lucky to have this kind of life but hey, no one gets the best of everything! I am fortunate to know there is such thing.

(and he is not good looking - this is THE point. haha)  ;  left the place abt 1030. really tired. but again i had fun. would love to go there again.  ;  this morning woke up to cook breakfast for uncle larry. hope he is not suffering from stomachache. he is so kind to deliver some letters and few boxes of chocolates for my family. i am so going to miss him. sob sob.  ;  the ppl here love to talk loudly. i am suffering from headaches for the past few days. and they slang very strongly. wah lau. the only time i have some peace is during lunch. urgh.  ;             \n",

(yes in sampan to go home. hahah)  yesterday made a HUGE mistake at work. i printed out a wrong set of documents and put it into a contract. thank goodness it was discovered before the vendor hope onto the plane back SG. else... i dunno what will happen. suffered many paper cuts, and i think i killed many more trees than i think i should. hikes! then boss ask me: so have you tried to negotiate with them (there's some issue i am supposed to trash out with the supplier)and get them to agree to our terms. i really tried. i think my weakness is i have a soft ear... instead of them agreeing to us, i helped them to look for the stuff! haiyo, must be hard. boss say 'this is how it is like. Who has the buying power? If (whoever has it) say jump off a bridge, the other must oblige. if he say kneel you must kneel. IF U WANT THE CONTRACT. else u can just walk off.   that's how business goes is it?  For the less than 14 days i am here, i have been having dinners and lunches with suppliers. They pay the bill of cos. it's so different working here. in SG, i can't even be allowed to be seen with supplier outside. here.. well, guess it's much lax here. much much more. really unused to the fact i am eating for free most of the time.   one of the SG uncles going home soon. then my boss going back to collect his work permit (meaning no need to renew his visa every one month kind. its a semi perm, for 6 months to 2 years). then i will be alone here. the uncle is so nice, he cook breakfast for me everyday, and yup, i have definitely put on weight. theres a gym at my block. will visit it when free. but these days been so tired and always reached home at nite. dunno where to find the time to lost weight. i think i will join the advance club. not bui bui but FAT FAT.   i am using ICQgo! at work, meaning i can chat online as long as i have internet but i dun have the contacts. i need to add again. if u girls have, then add me: 82702332 (Suzzie). i will turn it on everyday at work from 8am to 6pm. hope to see u all soon.           \n",

Lost abt SG$15 from gambling. never have luck in these kind of money. I cooked this thing taught by Larry, the E&A guy who is gg back SG soon- Dumpling with Banana (and some jello like sweets). NOT BAD!!! my virgin dish received good comments! hahahha. i made some ham sandwich too,  just in case the dumplings sucked.   Got to know this Brazilian Born Taiwanese at the gathering.. she is working in Fels Setal (Keppel Fels in Brazil). Pretty lady, and she was commenting how brave I am to come to brazil to work.   To me, its really an opportunity idiotic to miss. Maybe even if sent to middle east I will seriously consider. The world is getting so much smaller. I will only be a frog in bottom of the well if I stay in SG. No offence to those who beg to differ. I mean its individual preferences, especially if one already has a direction and a goal in mind. No point diverting and get lost. Maybe I am just adventurous.   Sun was a rainy day here, 17Deg. Who on earth say Brazil is a sunny place!!! hehe, no lah, its just the winter.  Found a shopping plaza near my place. Goodness, it is huge. the clothes are much cheaper than in SG. haha. now i noe where to go on weekends.  Will be learning to drive once i have some basic portuguese. here no car is so inconvenient! but boss say he is scared i go out alone.. that i may get into trouble. think he meant with the police or so.. heard horror story that they demanded US4000 from our guy when he and his family didnt bring passport with him. but later bargain to R100 (abt SG60 or so).   thats the update for now... have asked Fels to give me internet connection. dont care. i am getting so BORED in my apt.             \n",

      "             5 July 2004 Brazil RJ   Yo people!!!!  I just got internet access at my workplace!   it was a very tiring but fun weekend.  We reach Paris in the morning at abt 7am. checked into a day hotel (Euro 89 for that few hours!!!!) and went to Eiffel Tower. my 2 idiotic colleagues think they could just ask around in the sub way station while i thot they knew the way... so i went back and ask the receptionist. anyway french are snobbish assholes who think that French is the best language so if u speak english ' sorry i don't understand you' urgh! but we were lucky to bump into an old couple who were going in that direction and we figured out the way to get there altogether. after the effiel tower trip we went back to hotel in taxi (no train. won~t be able to make it for teh plane if we did!) i was napping and when i woke up, my legs were so jelly that i fell on the carpet and scratch myself!!!! my knee bled! hahahahhaaa.. was too tired on the 13 hour flight.   then another 12 uneventful hours and we reached Rio at 630, 2 of us stay at 2 different apt in Rio city while the other colleague went to our yard 3 hours away. went shopping with 3 uncles and at nite attended a party. the brazilian gals are BEAUTIFUL with GREAT bodies. now i am thinking, i won~t be able to achieve my goal: to find a boyfriend here... sob sob...  sunday went to another town, where our yard is based at. the aptments where one of the colleague is staying face the BLUE sea. oh my goodness. it~s really 'got money also can't buy'. really really beautiful but out of the way. it's almost a 3 hour drive to town  my apt is great too, facing the famous sugar loaf cliff and the jesus christ statue. really FACING. but next to us are slums... and last nite i heard gun shots for teh 1st time. the nite is lited up by the slums located in the hills... the city is so beautiful with the colourful stars. but it's ironic that the nite beauty of brazil is shone by the poorest.   today 1st day of work. already anticipating lots of things to come my way. will show u all the pics next time, i loaded into my laptop.   AND DID I MENTION THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE SO CUTE! THERE' S THIS GUY I BE WORKING WITH ON A PROJECT WHO LOOKS LIKE THE CLARKE KEN SUPERMAN?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE BRAZIL!!! hahhahaha love you all. muaks  Greetings from RJ Brazil. PS: I still be accessing this email. but just in case this is my other working acc: DaChin@technip.com sounds stupid hor.          \n",

      "             17 Jul 04 Uncle Larry left for SG last nite. What an adventure. My boss and I left the office early at 5 pm, rush to take the ferry home. Larry cooked for us a sumptuous meal of salmon, pork braised in country wine, soup and lembak chicken (something like lontong). We left our place at 715pm to catch a 1020 plane. Thot we have more than ample time to get there, but we missed a turn and got into this bus terminal town. It was a busy town, streets filled with peddlers trying to sell things like fruits. Many kids running around selling things to the cars stuck in jam. We lost our way and couldnt get out. Larry hopped into a cab with his luggage, then me and boss followed him. Then we get stuck in a jam for about half hour with my boss and Larry getting anxious. We saw children climbing up a lorry and stealing drink. Then a kid run up to our car and cleaned the window. Poor things. Finally we got out of the jam after much swearing and cursing and reached the airport. But Larry wasnt around! The taxi driver left him lower level  arrival hall. By the time he queued up, he was the last 2nd one. And he has to pay overweight charges of US$1000 (over by 23 kg). And when he wanted to take one luggage out  no, it has been sent in, and we dont have time to do that. Poor thing.; just got to learn that he need not pay afterall. think he will be refunded. ;  Today is a rainy day. My plan to visit the nearby shopping center, with many stalls in the alley like basar malam was drenched by the rain. The wind was huge today. Cant wait for summer to come, really dont like the cold, and cant do so many things. I havent seen so many places with the weekends all wet and cold! I am hoping tomorrow will be a better day. I am not asking for bright sunny day but please stop raining! But finally I get to enjoy my apartment. I am very at home at my place now. But the real test hasnt come yet  cooking. Think I brought all the Chinese ingredients for nothing. Would rather go out and buy something than cook! Hated the oiliness and the cleaning.;  ;  Melissa is a very sweet girl. She offered to bring me around, and gave me her number so if I want to go around I can call her anytime. Such a sweet girl.  ;  Tonite a colleague is cooking dinner. Ah  boss just called.

      "             25 July 2004  There were little kids hanging out a street just outside our hotel. Maybe about 7 years old in torn jeans and worn out clothes. Saw them on Sat afternoon and Sun morning. Were they there all the time? They were hunging small boxes of chewing gums and sweets, probably trying to sell.   I have also seen kids knocking at the car windows at red-light junctions, asking for money.   Don't the government have welfares for them?  It is saddening to see, they have to endure the;hardships of life at such an early age. What will become of them in the future? Probably end up as local valet parking service-provider, getting R$1 or R$2 for each parked car. Or peddlers selling snacks along the Niteroi bridge to the cars stuck in jams, in freezing cold rainy days.  life is unfair.           \n",

      "             24 - 25 Jul 2004  Left for Sao Paulo on 24 Sat morning.   Selso is;a brazilian Tommy sent to pick me up at 515 am. Well, i overslept and thank goodness he call woke me up. rush down in 10 mins and as usual, duck and chicken talking.   he went to pick up another guy, a caucasian at a hotel in Rio then we went to meet the rest of the guys; Tommy, Samantha and Lionel. Me and Lionel took Selso's car and luckily, they can communicate through hand language. I was totally lost.   It took us about 6 hours to reach Sao Paulo, stopping for snacks along the way. Brazil is scenic, with so many mountains and hills. We passed by this lake or river, and cos it was still early, there was a layer of fog just above the water. Can't decide it's mystically beautiful or just plain eerie.   Selso had to stop to ask for directions to our hotel, Blue Tree Tower. Many times. he would wind down his window at EVERY opportunity and asked the driver or passer by how to go there. I think he asked more than 10 times before we found the place. Heard that is the case in brazil, one shouldn't trust only a person's direction advice cos they would point different places, cos they want to help.   But brazilians are really helpful. On our way to the shopping centre, Selso did the same thing, and there was this uncle who stopped his car and came to tell us how to get there. and as we con't the same direction for a while, he would yell to us how to get there at EVERY opportunity also. But we still got lost. Especially we have to coordinate with the other car Anthony is driving it was tough. we circled around a stadium (today there was a match, Brazil with Mexico or Argentina, not sure. but just heard alot of shouting and fireworks, think Brazil must have won) with policemen on horses. Wow, damn cool.   There, we finally had our lunch at 2 plus. Chinese food (Tommy Sam and Anthony wanted that. Me and Lionel were like, we have been eating many types of food, BUT brazilian food). And went shopping for 2 hours. bought a pair of shoes at R$50, a bit too tight cos no size. a thick jacket (really warm) R$60, a pair of jeans abit too loose on the backside, or i have a thick waist... have to alter back in SG, at R$40, and 2 Zara tops at R$18. Great buys, i think, for 2 hours for less than SG$100.   Sam was sick, so we went back to the hotel and rest. Later that nite the rest of us went to the nitespot in SP. We went to this pub but the nite ended early cos Tommy suffered from both gastric attack and Lao Sai, and Anthony was tired. I gulped my Malibu and ended up sleeping in the car. Cos the guys wanted to see the Red Light district, helpful Selso (who had taken 12 Caparinas, a very strong local drink and 2 Beers in the Pub) asked EVERYONE how to get there. The waiters, the bouncers, the passerbys.. so in the end everyone knows where we are going. In the end, we decided to go back hotel since the whole of SP knew where we planned to go.   The next day was short. We went to a flea market downstairs. The stalls sold old old stuff, and makes me wonder who would want to buy them. Collectors maybe. Saw a couple of nice earrings but the thot that it might be worn b4 gives me the creeps. As we walked on there was this parade on the whole stretch of road. Stalls selling handicrafts, art work, earrings, blah blah were set up on the road side. A fortune teller yakking in portuguese with his bird tried to give me;a telling, but due to communication failure, i decided not.   There was dance showcase on stage. Dancing hot samba like dances, and one performance replayed Dirty Dancing. Was fantastic. Further there was a lady teaching how to dance something like line dance. it seemed easy, was so tempted to join in!   The stalls offer so many things and so cheap. i bought 4 pairs of earrings, and 2 handicraft - handpainted tiles, at R$3/ pair and R$5/ pc. so cheap. too bad we couldn't really explored thoroughly, cos we need to check out at 12pm. Finally reached my nest at 7pm and was greeted with a spoiled tv and a flooded bathroom.   Actually SP is a big city. I think these kind of flea market is common in Brazil, and ironically i have yet to go to any in Rio. Comparing, I think i like Rio more, cos they have more to offer like beaches and many more beautiful things, the Christ Redeemer and Sugar Loaf.   It was a good weekend after suffering in silence in Office. =) hope i am recharged before facing another week.             \n",

      "             1 Aug 04 Sun  Went to the Hippie Market at Ipanema. So nice! bought quite a bit of things.. Many handicrafts are sold. one stall sells face masks made of leather (interesting). Art pieces are also sold. We ate African traditional food, which i didn't like. This young girl came to ask for food we didn't finish. really poor thing. Then saw golden retreivers puppies being sold. The parents are also there, i guess to show the potential buyers the good breed. As we walked along, huskies, chihuahuas, terriers, cocker spaniel are sold too. SO CUTE. urgh. altho i dun agree with selling them, but at least they are in hands of animal lovers. was thinking abt the pet breeding farms in Singapore. haiz, think the animals here have a better life.  31 Jul 04 Sat  Spend the 1st half of the afternoon at a chinese restuarant with the SG ppl. It was the looongest lunch i have ever taken. we arrived at 1pm, and the food came at 2.30pm. we left the restuarant at 3.30pm. it was so long, that big boss had to tell the owner to hurry up serve the food, cos he has to leave for the airport at 4pm!  Then Lionel, Sabah, Melissa, her son Joshua and me went to Sugarloaf. It was beautiful. There is a pub also (brazilians love to party, and will create any opportunity to do so). Then there are groups of ppl exercising. not the SG kind of old ppl doing taichi, but doing aerobics, yoga (somehow seem like Falun Gong to me) and cycling (on stationery bikes... funny huh.)  From Sugarloaf can see the Christ statue on the next cliff. we also caught the sunset. beautiful.  At nite, Lionel and I went to the nite spots in Lapan. We went to the biggest disco. We did a test to see how many guys want to pick me up. so i went walking around alone. nope. but was molested by this idiot, who used his elbow to brush me! so angry, i pushed his arm away. hope his hand rots!  Then caught a few boys starting a fight in the middle of the dance floor. the security stepped in to stop it. one of the boys was stopped by a girl, and the whole event has a 'happy ending' with the winner smooching the prize away all nite. sounds like cavemen to us. hahaha. There was a band who came to the stage to sing, with dancers in the back. of cos skimpily dressed. The girls are not that hot, but one of the male dancer was W.O.W. great toned muscular body with a killer smile. The dancing was the main attraction, and whenever the gal expose her little panties under the short skirt, wolf whistles and cat calls are heard.  A fat man approached me for a dance. yah rite, over my dead body (which will be when he tripped over me during the dance). then as we leave, another young boy wants to talk to me.  WHY I ATTRACT PERVERTS, FAT GUYS AND YOUNG BOYS!!??           \n",

But I was abit upset when he said that he wants to make me the first woman project manager in Keppel Fels.  Wah lau, if i dun live up to the expectation then isn't it very 'throw face'. of cos happy that he has such high hopes on me, but must he tell everyone or not... Nevermind. say whatever he wants.  After dinner we went to a disco pub. It was nice, but the crowd is abit old (hang out with old men, what to expect. haha) Then Melissa told me that a fat man next to us while ordering drinks at the bar told her that he loves me! so funny, and he was yakking 'Chinatown Chinatown' to her. hahah... Then the night proceed on quite ok, danced with the SG ppl, and at the dance floor a young boy wanted to get to know me. Why do i keep attracting the WRONG ppl?

      "            Max Ehrmann Desiderata  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.  Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.  With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.       -------      I love the last line. Strive to be happy.

Its amazing how some people just cannot keep a secret. The only person that can be assured to keep a secret is number 1. I.e. Yourself.

      "    The other day I was rummaging through the garbage of a particularly fine looking establishment, when all of a sudden I came across a newspaper article documenting the recent campaign for the Presidency of the United States of America. After wiping a particularly runny egg from the front page, and promptly licking it off my hand, I took notice of the contents and a chortle escaped from my lips (as did some runny egg). There on the front page, the current President, Georgie Porgie Bush, was plastered (referring to the image and not his blood/alcohol level for once) in black and white; wearing a smug expression on his mug as if to suggest that he could cure all ails with his beady eyes and signature condescending smirk. I personally don't buy it. In fact, he tried to help us once, and he fucked up good and right. It was and continues to be the mess known as Iraq.   My thoughts on Bush are that he is merely a pretty boy lacking one important quality required to be a pretty boy, and that, my friends, is the privilege of being pretty. Prettiness is a gift from the gods that I just so happened to receive upon conception, so I speak from experience. Yet, I must be honest - the blessing of eternal prettiness can occasionally turn around and bite the beholder in the balls. I once met a doctor in the Lesser Antilles who referred to this as gonorrhea, but I'll thank you very much not to ask why I was inquiring about it in the first place.  So, back to the matter at hand, let me pose to you a question. Without a pretty face to fall back on, what does that leave our President Bush with? Intelligence? Obviously not. Charisma? Hell no. I'll tell you what it leaves him with. Absolutely jack squat! So what good is a President who has zero skills and nothing but piss poor qualities? None whatsoever. He's gotta go!  Never an offender of the equal time rule, the newspaper made sure that directly next to Georgie's photo was a picture of the slightly more grotesque Senator John F. Kerry. Along my travels I have read many cleverly executed articles making light of Kerry's striking resemblance to the fictional Mary Shelley character, the Frankenstein monster. While I normally extract no pleasure from the mockery of another's appearance, I must admit that Kerry's picture chilled this weary ole seafarer to the very core, and I'd say that the only thing he's lacking are two well-placed bolts and platform shoes. I'm sure he could borrow the stammer from Bush.  But while Kerry is not a pretty man, he does possess certain qualities that I find admirable in a leader, even though he has yet to attain that title. The most important of these qualities is that he has taken a human life. Hell, I'm sure ole Johnny's robbed several Vietcong souls during his tours of Vietnam, and I'd wager my left eyeball that he's offed more than a few transients upon his return to the states. If you gave me a ten minute search of his house I'd present you with a necklace made of ears!  But before you denounce me as a heartless lunatic with no credibility to judge character, please allow me to explain why I find murder a good quality in a leader. For one, it shows that he is a man who takes initiative. Instead of sitting on his ass, listening to Jimi Hendrix, smoking reefer, and waiting to catch a bullet with his forehead - or getting his daddy to keep him safe for that matter - Kerry wandered the countryside adding notches to the butt of his gun like any proud American would. It proves that he can make decisions and stand by them. If that does not a leader make, then I shall fashion a shiv and jab myself in the gullet right this very second!  I cannot begin to elaborate on Kerry's other promising qualities, because personally I feel that his passion for slaughter is reason enough to appoint him as the head of our great country. Though, despite the fact that I have been applauding his achievements these past few paragraphs, I want to add that Kerry is simply the lesser of two evils. In a perfect world, neither of these two dolts would have been permitted to run for the presidency in the first place. However, being that this is not a perfect world, as evidenced by the fact that I was severely abused as a child and presently have no place to call home, I submit that Kerry would do less harm than Bush already has.  As I stood in front of the trash can daydreaming about the state of our country, a thought crept into my mind like a mouse looking for cheese in a bear trap. What we need is a president who will run this country the way it deserves to be run; not some cartoonish puppet! We need a man like Quint McGuinley! I've been a traveler most of my life. I can wander the countryside and campaign for the good of this greatest of islands! If I can impress upon a few people in each town the importance of writing my name on the ballot, and they can convince others to do the same, then all hope is not yet lost!   I clutched that newspaper to my chest and crumpled it in my hand so that what was left of the chicken embryo dripped down my forearm and stuck to my arm hair (promising a good nighttime snack). Then I looked to the heavens and thanked the gods for providing me with yet another glorious epiphany. I thought I heard a response, but soon realized it was merely a noise coming from behind the house. As I tilted my noggin for a better listen, it seemed as though the noise was getting louder. Wouldn't it figure that what I heard was the guttural howl of six Rottweilers who were not yet privy to the fact that I was going to be the next president of the United States? I made an attempt to run from the yard, but the unmerciful beasts were on me in seconds! I fought tooth and nail with the little scrappers, but as I had not yet consumed any Pabst Blue Ribbon that day, my legs were still a tad shaky. Sure enough, the buggers had me on the ground quicker than you could say 'Antarctica' and it took all my might to keep them from tapping into my jugular like a bunch of fratboys on a keg of Keystone Light.  The wretched little bastards gnawed at my extremities for a good couple of hours until I finally managed to crawl outside the perimeter of the electric fence and their collars rendered them incapable of any further attacks on my person. Despite massive blood loss and severely tattered clothes that left nothing to the imagination, I believe I fought the good fight that day. And as I crawled back to the abandoned railway car that I had fashioned into a temporary home, I was filled with a new sense of purpose. A euphoria coursed through my veins that I had not felt in years, and while it could just as easily have been the onset of tetanus, I took it as a sign to begin planning my next move to become the next president of the United States of America...      \n",

      "   A comrade of mine once equipped me with the knowledge that nurse sharks are apparently one of the most docile species of shark in the great blue sea. Well, the pure thought of an easygoing shark was absurd to me, and being a man of first hand facts, I made it a point to seek out said nurse shark and find out the truth for myself.  So, I chartered a boat and set out on the waves of the seductive Atlantic to seek my answers, ultimately sailing for fourteen days before I finally found what I was looking for. Turns out I spent most of that time wandering the deck deeply entrenched in the chartreuse haze of an absinthe binge.  Well, upon regaining my faculties I noticed that my sandpaper-skinned treasure was hovering in wait directly below my ship, which I had only just realized bore the name Saras Nipple on the bow.  What an odd name for a ship, I thought to myself, chuckling like Santa Claus.  Only my belly was very much unlike a bowl of jelly.  If I had to liken it to anything, Id say its more like anything that holds various internal organs, some Jim Beam, and occasionally about a pint of lacquer thinner, and happens to be encased in multiple layers of fatty cells.  But thats beside the point.  So there they were.  Swimming around like giant toothy worms were four deadeyes, as I like to refer to them, grinning up at me.  I couldnt be sure, but I thought I heard one of them say,  Oh look, its Quint.  Hi Quint, you sonuvabitch!  After wrestling me back, me mates tried to tell me that praps I was daydreaming again, or that maybe I had a bit too much sun, but I was under the impression that these damn fish were taunting me and I wouldnt stand for it!  So I donned my two-sizes too small (for intimidation purposes) wetsuit, fastened my goggles to my ocular cavities and steadied my mind to concentrate on the task ahead.  My first mate, Richard Dreyfuss, recommended that I also wear a scuba tank, but I promised him that it should take no longer than a single breath would allow for me to prove the superiority of man to these unwitting sharks.  So, with nothing more than a flashy wetsuit, goggles, an erection, and not to mention my rapist intensity, I cannonballed into the chill waters of the mother Atlantic that day and cordially invited all three of the easygoing phallic symbols to engage in a bout of fisticuffs.  Being that they were slightly better swimmers than I, it took quite some time before I managed to close the gap between us, but once I did, let me assure you, there were no more thoughts of taunting ole Quint McGuinley running through their tiny little shark brains.  I could read their minds via the vacant expressions on their streamlined little faces and Ill tell you what they were thinking.  All three of them were thinking: Holy areolas, what the hell did we go and get ourselves into?  This specimen before us is indeed superior in every possible way.  At first it was difficult to detect the awesome mass of greatness that is this man, yet alas, here it is, for all to see.  The oversized fish silently pleaded with me to take pity on them.  Their beady shark eyes stared at me like black holes and I could almost swear on my seven dead wives graves that I saw a tear.  But they refused to attack.  They were smart, Ill give them that; the stubborn bastards almost had me believing the hoopla about them being docile animals.  But I was wise to their game.  I knew that no sooner than my retreating foot would touch the wooden deck of Saras Nipple that those beasts would unleash their stifled chortles for all to be heard.  Quint McGuinley, theyd say, why if ole Quint McGuinley is as big a pussy on land as he is at sea, then we wouldnt be surprised if he were runnin home to drink a bottle of vinegar and water to freshen up.  So rather than face such horror, I remained exactly where I was, albeit not taking into account the sporadic bobbing up and down caused by waves.  I stroked my beard for a second, smirked, cocked an eyebrow, eyeballed my cock, and eventually puffed out my glorious barrel of a chest and swam the butterfly stroke toward my adversaries.  As it turns out, I was correct. The animals were vicious and unrelenting beasts. However, it did take some coaxing on my part, and by coaxing I mean that I had to grip the sharks by the gills and bludgeon them about the head and face area with my muscular forearm for several minutes before they finally retaliated. But ultimately I proved my point. And that's how, sans my left leg, I hopped back onto the boat that sunny day and smiled to Richard Dreyfuss.  'Peanut brittle ass,' I said to him, 'the transaction that has transpired today will forever change the course of world history.  This fete will be lauded as the most invaluable of all human accomplishments and you can be certain that the good Lord is looking down upon me with disdain that could only be considered a thorn on the stem of jealousy.' Apparently, I passed out shortly after making that proclamation though you wouldn't have known it by the fact that I continued to wear my trademark grin and my one-legged form remained standing upright on deck. Sure, I lost a leg that day.  Some say I lost a little respect, too.  But not a single second goes by where I think to myself, If I could do all that over again, and skip out on the part where I jump into the ocean and pick a fight with three sharks to avoid future problems like phantom limb pain and massive diarrheawould I?  Would I indeed!  Not that I think about that kinda stuff, because I dont!  But if I did, my answer would be NO, I wouldnt skip out on that part!  Quint McGuinley is a man among men!  It has oft been rumored that one time, on an expedition through the Rocky Mountains, he savagely beat a grizzly bear to death for sassing him about eating the entire food supply in one sitting.  Some folk say that the rations consisted of a single can of beans, and still others like to pass word that it was six full-grown elephants that he consumed that day.  Of course it is also rumored that I, Quint Quintly McGuinley, spun that little tale while engaging in a Moonshine chugging competition somewhere along the coast of the Amazon River.  Whichever it was, you can rest assured that ole Quint is as grizzled as they come and theres no way in hell hell ever quit referring to himself in the third person, no matter how hackneyed it becomes.  And another thing, when I commit myself to a cause, you can be damned sure that I wont give up until the day that I am struck dead.  In fact, you probably cant even be certain then.  The Lord knows Ive pillaged entire villages during REM sleep, so why the hell should death halt my endeavors?  Well, lately Ive been hearing tell of more peaceful (and I suspect Cannabis imbibing) sharks and Im plum sick of it!  Theyre all vicious carnivores as far as Im concerned and Im fully committed to proving it.  In fact, I'm planning a trip in a few months to the Pacific to display to the world that Whale Sharks aren't the pushovers that people say they are.  Im so convinced of their innate savageness that Ill make the claim right now that I will sever my right leg with a toothpick if the Whale Sharks dont do it themselves; I promise you that!  Some people have said to me, Quint, are you nuts?  Making a claim like that just means youre going to lose a leg either way.  What do you stand do gain by such an idiotic stunt?  And I look them dead in the eye, wonder for a minute whether they are siding with the sharks, and then I stammer: A leg is a paltry price to pay for an accurate catalog of the temperament of oceanic species.  At which point theyll reply: But Quint, wake up!  Youre offering up a second leg!  Two legs are surely way too much to lose for such an absurd experiment you drunken asshole!  To which Ill retort: Whats that, landlubber?  Speak into me good ear!  And when they fall prey to my ruse and lean over to assist what is actually a perfectly healthy ear, I chomp off each of their own ears and spit them on the table.  And then I lean over and say: Now would you say those ears were worth your opinion, landlubber?  'Hardeeharhar!'  And thus concludes another entry in the journal of Quint Quintly McGuinley!   \n",

That's more like it although I suspect it's one of the smurf's name.... ????   1st try:  Input 1st name: Weeloy Input last name: Goh  My Hobbit name: Bingo Bleecker-Baggins of Fair Downs   Bingo? BINGO!   Bleecker-Baggins? Am I related to Frodo and Bilbo?  2nd try:  Input 1st name: Terence Input last name: Goh  My Hobbit name: Togo Bleecker-Baggins of Fair Downs   Ha! Just as bad.  Just for kicks I tried out my female names:  For Elvish, I got a Eldrwen and a Ern Falassion.  For Hobbit, I got a Polly and a Iris Bleecker-Baggins of Fair Downs.  That's it, from now I shall be called Ern (pronounced ARE-RAH-NEI) Falassion, Elvish Princess.  Yes, laugh all you want. I still got a cool name plus I was Eowyn for the Lord of the Rings Test.  Better a cute girly than an ugly hobbit (High 5, Kenny)!  (For more middle earth names, please check this site out too.   CLICK HERE !)  Cheers!    \n",

      "   You know Singapore Football has hit rock bottom when the only Chinese dude in the team gets the boot from the National Team.   'Tan quits national team after being axed' -  Streats, 22 July 2004  Yes sir, that's Mr Tan Kim Leng for you. You know the guy with the chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in his condo somewhere? Yup, it's him all you envious, red-eyed cretins out there.  How could the FAS;do that? Don't they know that the guy represents 75% of the population of Singapore? Very soon, they are gonna axed the Malays who represents 20% and then the Indian (5%).   That will leave us with 0% of our races (if you don't include the 0 point something Eurasian community here) in our National Team. So what are we gonna do?  Simple, just import them from all over the world. We already have guys from Africa, Brazil and Eastern Europe donning the ol' red and white of the Lions, having been granted citizenship for their short stint here.  And;they didn't even have to serve NS;for that!;Just do what they do badly - Kick a ball. When they reach retirement, they can pack their bags, slap their bums and;say 'Thanks for the money', then;laugh all the way back to their native countries.  Thanks for kicking the ball in our turf and taking our money away;dudes!  If the current trend of axing our national players continues, the team that represents Singapore at World Cup 3XXX will have none of our native born heroes. It has already happened at Sea Games 2003!   The entire team was made up of dumb blonds;with fancy boots who can't score to save their lives. They play as prettily as their pretty hair but they forgot that the goal of the game was to put the ball in the opponent's net. Duh!;  Back to the topic of Mr. Tan Kim Leng, the guy with the chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in his condo somewhere.  His sacking came after the recent debacle where the Lions fell again to our neighbours. You know we shouldn't call it a debacle anymore. Let's just call it a tradition. Everytime you hear our boys go play Malaysia, just say, 'Oh, we are gonna lose again.' :-c  When told of FAS' decision to axe him from the squad, the very defiant Tan retorted, 'No problem. I won't go back to the national team. I'm someone who plays with passion, but what do I get in return?'  If red is the colour of passion then;Mr. Tan;is truly a passionate man (he's got a;chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in his condo somewhere, you know). Every match he plays, he sees red. The guy was rewarded for his passion by seeing red yet again in last year's Asia Cup qualifier where we got thumped 4-0 by Kuwait.  Following last year's humiliating 4-0 thumping by Malaysia (you know those guys who always;claim it's our fault when things go wrong?) at home, the boys set out across the;Causeway to regain some of our pride.  All the signs were looking good for a win for us. We had a full squad while the Tigers had 5 of their regulars missing from their squad comprising mostly of their U-23 squad. Yup, the same fellas who spanked;us at the National Stadium last year.   Well, we did regain some measure of pride. We lost 2-0 only this time. Well done, boys! Next time it will;be 0-0!;  I believed that the match was held at the Bukit Jalil Stadium, a 40-50,000 capacity stadium but only 1,000 spectators turned up to watch the game.  If they tell me that these;guys paid for the tickets, I will shoot them. Paying spectators? Bah!  We all know that when any delegation from;Singapore goes over to Malaysia, a whole plethora of officials or what have you accompanies along. You know, like excess baggage.  I bet my butt that the 1,000 are made up purely of officials from both sides. We will probably make up 80% of the crowd because we have more money of course. Duh.....  So who are these guys there then?  The Goal 3xxx commitee no;doubt.   FAS bigwigs and their family members.;They were given complimentary tickets to the game.  Former Goal 2010 officials like Jan Poulsen and his cabal. FAS had thought that our boys would wipe the smirk off their faces and justify their decision to axe them. Of course after the game, these guys still have their smirks and their wallets just as full.  The commitee who sacked the Goal 2010 commitee. They are the ones who suggested that tickets to be given to Jan Poulsen and the rest. They also wanted to see the smirks wiped off his face. So who's laughing now?  The commitee who is going to sack the commitee who sacked the Goal 2010 commitee. The game hasn't been concluded at that point but Singapore very kiasu one you know. They are there just in case.  The various who is going to sack who commitee. The one for Tan Kim Leng no;doubt was there and taking tons of notes.;  The rest are made up of runners who are supposed to get kacang putih and kua chi for their bosses.  When you add those numbers up, it is quite surprising that their numbers only make 800 of our good folks. Maybe the commitee who is going to sack the 800 did not make the trip. Otherwise they would have doubled the numbers.  My heart would have gone out to you Mr Tan. It's hard to play when you know you have so many eyes scrutinising your passionate display.  But hey, at the end of the day, you still;got your;chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in;your condo somewhere. Now that's something I will never sympathised with!  Cheers dude!   \n",

      "   Here's the update on my bro's eternal rat/mouse problem (only in Myammar folks, only in Myammar):   Thanks for your wonderful (and some not;so wonderful);suggestions;re dealing with my rat problem. It's amazing that the same problem applied to both sexes can wield so;varied a result. Here's some of them....  Suggestions from Martians - Lace bait food with some chemicals like bleach or something... might help to kill them... and since the rat actually goes back and i think they regurgitate for the 'kids'. so if its poisoned... you kill the kids too... i hope (those from ntu and/or cornerstone probably can guess who this brilliant person is)- 'Pengkang' some cuttlefish to tempt the rat - Use industrial bait glue.... equally powerful ;- shud use the cage one, its more expensive but u get the satisfaction of drowning them when u catch them. how u do it? dump the whole cage in a pail of water, best way is to put the cage in the pail and slowly fill u the cage with water. u will see how the rats run about nervously and their last moments when gasping for whatever little air they have left. hurhurhur  Suggestions from Venus - Use sweet food. Feed it lots of sugar and let it die of diabetes. - btw, read in enid blyton (story: the doll that lost its squeak, in case you wanna verify the info given) that rats love wax...so if you've a couple of candles or tealights, that may do the trick.  - Cheese  Morale of Story:  Beware of those from Venus. Even when they are plotting to kill you, they are capable of masking it with tender loving care. Guys you have been warned. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!   ; My suggestion? Buy a cat!   \n",

So what does this show? That in Myanmar, the guys still get the raw end of the deal :-(  - that in Myanmar, I still can find my coca cola, MacDonald's and KFC, except that it is called Star Cola, Mac Burger and KLCC - I kid you not. Same recipes, same formula:-)  -;if I see a doctor in Myanmar, and call myself like U Jaw Danai, it will cost me 50 times less than if I report myelf as Mr Goh Danny :-)  - the mean of 'chit say yar lay'. It means cute in Burmese. It is also the most common phrase that people use on me :-) HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!  - The;modernization of the Singapore medical services can be summed up by taking a look at;the knees of my Singaporean colleague in Myanmar.;He has had three operations on both his knees. First one left him with a 30 cm scar (normal surgery), second one with a 15;cm;scar;and the last one with a 5 cm scar;(microscopic keyhole treatment). Ah, the wonders of science.  -;The office phone bill for last month came up to about USD 1,000.....;Those that have been sending me large files (those above 0.25mb), I am begging;you once;to stop sending.;;;  - 'Computers for Dummies';Lesson 1: To check file size, right click on file, select properties, see;general tab under size. 1,000kb;= 1 mb.;  - ;'Computers for Dummies' Lesson 2: Alternatively, to check file size, mouse-over designated file and wait, properties of file will be displayed in a;pop-up window.  - 'Computers for Dummies';Lesson 3: Mouse-over means moving your mouse to the selected file in question.  - If Lessons 1 to 3 are making sense to you for the first time, good luck to you:-) It may high time that you seriously consider a switch in careers, preferably to one that does not involve the use of computers:-)  - Speaking of mouse, my housemate and I brought in two rat traps to deal with the rat issue at place last week. Not those;humane cage kind, those you see in the cartoons with the recoil that;snaps;the back of the rat. OK, OK, so its pretty cruel - but bo pian, this is;the;only bloody rat contraption that they sell here.... the cage one is too expensive.- It has been about a week, so far the score is rat 3 danny 0. Lemme see, so far, he has robbed me of one bar of;kit kat, a whole chocolate biscuit and some Japanese crackers.;  - The recoil on those rat traps are damn bloody powerful. I should know. While setting it up, I accidentally triggered the trap. It nearly left me with a broken finger. Luckily all I had from the experience was a very bruised finger and an equally bruised ego :-)  - I am open to suggestions as to what food do rats like to eat, coz I;am seriously running out of ideas:-)  - I am boring more and more people to death with my emails.

      "   Keith Andrew Morton Born     : 5th June 1979 Departed : 15th August 2004     This was someone I know from my secondary school days although though he was not from my school or that i know him that well.  The epitaph above were his actual words in 'Friendster'.  His story appears on the Straits Times 16th August 2004,  P3 .   [Click Here]   I met the guy only a few times before his passing but I always thought he lived his life as he said he said he would.  A few years ago, my football team beat his team 5 - 1 when he was not around. They beat us 2 -1 the next time round when he played. Since then my team mates have always been talking about him.   He was one heck of a player.  I learnt from people close to him (and this was also reported in the news) that he had just returned from cooking school in England and was starting his own restaurant soon.  I heard he was one heck of a cook.   Pity I will never find out how good.  I thought he was one heck of a person.  Those who know him mourn for him deeply. So do I, even though I do not know him well.  His passing has left a void in many people's life for he was the light in many people's life.    His passing is like a candle snuffed out too soon to leave the world a little less brighter.  Rest in peace, Keith.  May angels watch over your sleep.  \n",

      "   The sun crept up the Andonean Range, scaling to the summit in labourious fashion. Light trickled lazily into the bamboo forest below, nibbling away at the fringes of the departing dusk. As the sun reached its zenith at the top of the highest peak, the creatures of the day awoke to the rebirth of the sun and then the place suddenly exploded into life.  Light poured into the forest like a ferocious wave, revealing the forest in its most resplendent glory. It shimmered like a green emerald at the foot of the mountain, pristine and bright. If the Andonean was a king, the bamboo forest was like the finest cape he wore. And if the sun was God, He was surely bestowing all His glory upon the forest with His light.  Any traveler standing on the top of the Andonean would surely have been awed by the spectacular view below him. He would surely have been captivated by the sheer beauty of the forest in the morning light. His imagination would surely have been stirred by the sights and sounds he would have beheld if he had set foot within its confines.  Its sweet lullaby and wondrous beauty was like a siren call to any traveler but there were those who would hardly be tempted by it.   He had stood since dusk in the middle of the bamboo forest, watching the ascent of the sun up the mountains. He had looked on unflinching and unimpressed as the burst of fire suddenly swept into the forest. The light of sun lit his eyes, fueling the purple flames that were his orbs. He stood as if staring directly at the sun as it straddled the top of the mountains, staring defiantly in the face of the fire god. For how many could look upon the fire god and not be harmed by it?  No one that was except Kenzen.  Having defeated the fire god, he turned his back to it, like a victor turning his back to a shamed and vanquished foe. His expression was impassive as ever in spite of his victory. He had never allowed anyone to look beyond that boyish face.   Ever.  His purpose in the bamboo forest was not done yet though. A more fearsome foe awaited, the only man in the whole world who could strike fear in Kenzens heart.   Kenzens super keen sense of hearing was strained to the limit as he tried to pick out the direction of his foes methodical and confident footfalls. It was a near impossible task and he could swear that the man floated instead of walked. He relished a challenge more than anyone and he had never been bested in combat all this while. His erstwhile opponents had been swept aside with consummate ease and he had not had a serious fight for the longest time.  Such are the hazards of a reputation that preceded him.  Then, out of the blue, as fate would decreed, the gods finally had enough of his supremacy and would conspire to fashion a opponent so awesome that he would strike fear even in the most invincible of beings.  Musa, the True Prince of Camorazzan.  His appearance startled Kenzen. For the first time in his life, he had failed to notice the arrival of his foe. The fact angered more than humiliated him. Still he felt in spite of that he would put things right again, the fear in him be damned. Musa, like all others before him, would be vanquished.  The prince smiled when he saw Kenzen. The latter could not help but cringed at the warmth of the princes smile. All his foes came armed with a scowl and with nothing but vengeance on their minds or filled with unadulterated hatred for him. No one but the prince came with the most disarming personality. The sincerity of his smile was like a dagger to Kenzens side. Kenzen had never been greeted like that before.  The prince was an anti-thesis of Kenzen. He was all magnetic charm to the latters aloofness. He was a picture of confidence and grandeur to Kenzen's well-hidden chasm of self doubts and fears and the latter's friendly disposition was a stark contrast to Kenzens morbid pensiveness.  Their differences were even more obvious in their physical appearance. The prince was tall, fair and strong while Kenzen was slight, dark and frail looking. The former looked magnificent in his all-white garb that complemented the splendour of the forest. Kenzens all-black attire on the other hand was an eye sore, an abomination amidst the beauty before and around him.   While there was an aura of positive energy emanating from the prince, the very air surrounding Kenzen seemed to wilt before him.  While the prince beamed, the latter scowled.  I thank you for accepting my invitation to meet me here, the prince spoke with sincerity, seemingly oblivious to the hostility oozing from the smaller man.  Kenzen almost gulped but checked himself in time. He would not show any weaknesses to his opponent. He had come here expecting a duel of sorts. This was the norm of his life - to fight one battle and one duel after another. He lived to fight and to relish the utter defeat of his foes at his very hands.   All the opponents he had encountered were battle ready and itching to fight him but not the prince though and that very notion scared him more than anything else.  Here in front of him for the second time in his life was a man who had no desire to kill or humiliate him. The first was Charity, but she was a thousand leagues away from here. Kenzen just did not know what to make of the seemingly gentle and unassuming man before him. The princes friendliness did more than just put him ill at ease; it made him even more wary of him. He would never have survived this long in the world if he had let his guard down every so often.  Though he had never seen the prince in combat, he already felt part of the battle lost - the contests of wills. This was something he felt that the prince was peerless in. If so, then he would be a formidable opponent indeed. Kenzen had to steel his resolve before all was lost.  Enough of your niceties, he retorted, his voice weak compared to the princes. State your business you have with me here and be done with it!  The prince was momentarily taken aback by Kenzens tone as though hurt by the latters clear rejection the offer of his confidence. Kenzen smirked, regaining some of his lost confidence at the princes wavering demeanour. But to his horror, the prince recovered in no time at all.  I did come to parley with you, my friend, said the prince, now sporting a stern countenance. I merely wanted to establish an understanding with you.  I am not your friend and I never make friends with anyone, not even with a prince.  The prince sighed. It was not a sign of exasperation though. Rather, he was disappointed at Kenzens sarcasm. The vibe the latter got from the prince was akin to that of a parents disapproval of an errant and willful childs behaviour. The thought of that maddened him further. The blood rushed to his head.  Draw your damn weapon, prince, and fight me like a man!   I knew it would be difficult with you but nevertheless I will say what I will have to say then leave, if that is what you desire.  Great, I thought you will never start.  Come on, somethings going make you fight me! Come on, draw your weapon and fight me, dammit! Come on!     The prince continued, unperturbed by the latters callousness. You have a gift, its obvious, with the sword. And in your case, thats two! What you did back there was something never been seen or done before. You fight with more skill than all the weaponmasters of Camorazzan combined. But you fight like an animal, with no quarter or mercy given to anyone. You slaughtered many men out there yesterday. What you did to them was close to despicable.  Your point being?  You lack direction, a cause, Kenzen laughed aloud at that but allowed the prince to continued in spite of that. More than he knew it, he was intrigued at what the prince was driving at. You need a cause to temper your killing rage. You behave as if you have no respect for life whatsoever, your own included.   Are you God to tell me how to live my life?  The price sighed that sigh again. The heat in Kenzen rose up another notch and he had stealthily unbuckled his swords.  One more of that and I will surely kill you!   That would be too presumptuous of me wouldnt it? No, what I am to offer to you is something you might worth considering. I offer you a cause worth fighting and living for. Join me, Kenzen. Fight for me!  Now that is going way beyond presumptuous, isnt it? Join your cause? Join you, the enemy of my people and go against my people, my country and my king?  I never knew you were such a loyal subject.   Feleperon  and  Isenejaer  flew out of their scabbards in an instant. Kenzens face contorted in rage but somehow he just stood where he was. He was barely in control of himself anymore and he would pounce at any moment.  The prince appeared unfazed by the monstrosity that he had somehow conjured up before him as he went on, There is that monstrous anger I was talking about! I came here not to pick a fight but to offer an alliance with you. But I guess my friendship is something you have no desire of. But if its a fight you want then you shall have it!  With that, the prince whipped out his awesome saber  Sauraefie .     Finally!  A wicked smile found its way to Kenzens face. Though it was a grotesque sight, it had not the desired effect on the prince.   The prince stood face to face with the monster before him, unafraid and as stout-hearted as ever. It seemed like he had a point to prove to Kenzen and he was determined to see through its course.  Come and face the might of  Sauraefie !   That was all the invitation Kenzen needed.   To be cont.        \n",

      "   8.15 A.M Tuesday Morning....  Waiting for the morning rush hour train as usual.  Almost couldn't get my butt off the bed just now.   Monday Blues had taken a huge toll on me, I almost couldn't survive the onerous boredom and tediousness of work yesterday.     Well, no choice gotta make a living and people are leaching off me as always.     Sigh!   Standing by the platform, I suddenly had a flash of inspiration again.  Instead of standing around in the train and getting shoved around, I should make space for my self to be comfortable.  Yes, my own space!  Of course, I have already thought of the very wonderful  Personal Space Maker , so what I thought of was not a new invention but something that is much more feasible.  Yes folks, a foldable chair. Not the big ones but a mini one that looks like one of those movie directors use.  Heh heh!   Of course, it is not wise to put the chair anywhere on the train, especially in the middle. Those punks will just rush in and topple me over.   Bad Idea, the middle.  So, before the train arrives, I will just shove my way to the front of the crowd who would already be standing inside the yellow box.  You know, I could have sworn the box meant for something for these guys? Like you are supposed to stand behind the yellow lines?   Well, nobody seems to care about that, what more me, the eternal law abiding fool? I've had enough!  I figure that I will probably get a lot of irritated stares by doing that but no one will actually dare voice it out.  Hey, they let the guy in Bishan walk around the station aimlessly, sit on the edge of the platform and then junped into the path of the oncoming MRT.   No one bothered to even report the matter to the station's staff before all that even if they could tell he was a suicide case.  So, in typical Singaporean fashion, we will do what we always do when faced with an out of ordinary situation - use Eye Power.  That's an army term for just staring and not lifting a finger to help when needed or asked to.  Anyway, back to my ingenious plan... The best spot will be at the doors opposite of the the front doors. There, you can get to lean your back against the plastic panel by the side.   It's a good spot also because everyone else will be squeezing to the middle of the train. Can't imagine why when the back is relatively empty before we reach Jurong East Interchange.  Well, everyone's stupidity is my gain. Suckers.  I will probably attract a lot of attention but that's not neccessarily a bad thing.  My fellow commuters may think  that I a looney and keep their distance, thus according me with more space than I would need.  AH AH AH - I am starting to think I am a genius and the rest morons.  AHHHH! I can just imagine the comfort now.  No more getting shoved around, getting told off for trying to protect my hard-earned personal space and getting POKED in the most uncomfortable places by thoughtless and insensitive commuters.   The whole experience will be made perfect with a cup of coffee and this morning's papers.  Hey, I am sure there are no MRT laws against this right? I think I should patent this litle innovative thought also.   Can't afford to have too many competitors, you know.  Ok, dudes, later!    \n",

      "       'So how did that deal with the dead bum work out?' Andrew asked, referring to a story I recently wrapped up on police brutality, culminating in a week spent masquerading as a homeless person.  'Homeless person,' I corrected. Bums are people, too: most of 'em. 'Yeah. The dead guy.' In the last three days of my assignment I had stumbled upon a homeless man who had evidently decided to exit by the fire escape; he was still cooling when I found him and made the call to 911, only to be flatly refused help by the cops. Turned out the city didn't want to be tying up precious taxpayer money and time with some nobody druggie, or so I was told. Two days after my story went to press three cops resigned in controversy over a post mortem that revealed one hundred thirty-two bruises on the lower torso 'by blunt, heavy object'-- read baton-- and no prior history of drug use. Even a newbie cokehead would've known better than to snort an eightball in fifteen to twenty-five minutes, let alone the managing editor of the Homeless Times; a homeless man by choice for ten years whom it turns out was onto the same trail of copshop slight-of-deed that I had been sniffing out. Rodney King eat your heart out.  'Pick up the paper every now and then, maybe you'll learn something.' I don't slave away at my job to go unnoticed, even by someone who considers fortune cookies heavy reading. 'I just wanted the inside scoop; you know, the shit you left out of the paper.' 'Oh.' So he had read it. Maybe I should feel bad.  'I let them have both barrels; what you see is what you get.' The truck made an abrupt about-face into the convenience store parking lot just in time to save me from having to flog a dead bum. I'd been answering questions for a week and a half; the giddy feeling had worn off precisly thirty seconds into the first barrage of inquires. I always heard what fame does to a person; my name next to a frontpage spread barely constituted notoriety and already I was tired of the heckling I got everywhere I went. Always ask the questions, I repeated to myself.  'Two cases, and a tall boy or two if they have them.' Andrew reminded me as I slid out into the rain. I found the cases alright, but no tall boys. I smiled to myself for the first time in two weeks. There were two homeless people in line behind me at the register, gearing up for another night of boozy desolation. When I first joined their ranks, it broke my heart to see homeless men throw away what little they had on alchohol every night; by the time I left the streets I could hold my own with the best of 'em. The party's the same regardless of what circle you rub shoulders in, I thought as I listened to the two bums argue over pocket change. Only matters where you wake up in the morning.          'Hey, you're that anti cop guy at the newspaper, aren't you?', the store clerk asked as I ponied up for one case of light beer and a sixpack of good stuff. 'I seen your picture on the news.'  'Yeah, I'm the guy that wrote that article.' I contemplated grabbing the beer and making a break for it before the inquistion started when the cashier asked the two bums behind me,  'How's it like getting attention from the papers?'  That's it, I thought. I grabbed my beer and started for the door, thinking to nip this interview in the bud, but only got one leg shaking before the world began to resemble a merry-go-round on a Scott Weiland acid trip and I was forced to make an emergency exit by the fire escape.                       \n",

      "       I hate the rain.      Nothing serious, its just that with three straight days of the stuff I start to sympathize with Noah and that ark situation-- the inlaws, the smell. And I don't even own a cat.      While the rain drummed incessantly on the window overlooking 31st Street, I looked over my shoulder and took a medicinal shot of Jameson. Life is hard enough without sobriety.  Never look back, Samantha used to say; tonight though, forward visibility is zero and the radar's in the corner, quietly becoming inebriated.  Samantha had obviously never read Peter Egan-- hell, I didn't remember her reading anything but astrology, a tactic I thought odd for a law school hopeful. Forward visibility was never that great, I mused, or else perhaps I would have seen the animal's gaping maw before it ripped out my heart.        'Hair of the dog that bit me,' I said as I poured a shot into the old flagon, but got no response. Probably a good thing, considering I was the only person in the room. Sanity? Check. Another shot of Jameson? Check and check. The old flagon refills quickly on a rainy night, I noted with dry wit; the corollary being that the old bottle empties disproportionately faster. Maybe the Jameson bottle is still running on Dublin time and thus empties itself four hours early; maybe the distillers forgot to set this particular bottle for Texas time and it was still humming Greensleeves, unaware that we eat our meals on Central Standard around here. Maybe the bottle wasn't water resistant to fifty meters. As I was turning over this little-studied piece of Irish engineering, the kitchen table started shaking violently. I hit the ceiling. Collecting myself, I grabbed the cell phone and, making a mental note to never again use vibrate, calmly answered,        'Mule barn. Head ass speaking.'      'What time is it?' Fate rears its ugly head.      'I was just mulling over the idea of transatlantic time zone malfunctions--' I was unceremoniously interrupted by the drawl on the other end before I could finish my discourse on the mathematics of Irish whiskey drinking,       '--beer thirty!' Unused to horn conversations lasting this long, I felt diplomatic relations on the air waves becoming increasingly strained.         'I'm downstairs; get your ass down here before my truck floats away.' I didn't have time to look out the rain spattered window before I heard a click and was left holding the empty line. In a moment of questionable clarity I threw on my coat and grabbed a medicinal shot for the road, thinking that if I didn't get my ass downstairs the phone wouldn't be the only empty line I'd be left holding tonight. And besides, according to the Jameson bottle it was getting pretty late.       Only after I had climbed into my brother's party barge on wheels did I remember my promise to buy him beer tonight.      'How late does this taxi run?' I asked as we launched from the curb into modest traffic. The Jameson started to kick in just as we careened past a moving van that didn't seem to be moving at all.       'Store's gonna close we need a coupla cases.' Came the hurried reply.       'Shit! How many alcoholics you planning on feeding?' I tried to keep the waver out of my voice as we pulled into the oncoming lane to pass a slow moving Cadillac.       'Just you and me, bro.'      'Great. And I was hoping to masturbate in peace tonight.' The thought of throwing 'em back with my brother wasn't my first choice for a rain drenched Thursday; I really  was  looking forward to a little peace and quiet after recent events.             \n",

      "      The Office  Prepares to Pontificate    The first week in November means two things for college football fans: time to decide how many birds to barbeque for Thanksgiving, and time to ask a blessing for that dressing of NCAA football turkeybowl games.  How is my team doing this year? How can I get into the game?  Fortunately,  The Office  has answered the most important of these questions at  The Office  website-- the only resource for the consummate college fan. In a scant three weeks, Universities and fans alike will be preparing themselves for the cornucopia of football feasting:  2003 Rose Bowl Champions; 2003 Cotton Bowl Champs.  Bowl Game Champions is a mouthful every fan loves to say, and every team loves to hear.  Cold weather, cold beverages and hot football are the bread and butter of college fans, and this season  The Office  is catering the party.  With bowl games already listed in  The Office's  inventory, fans can purchase their happiness now without the hassle of freezing lines at the stadium, or half hour phone calls, or last minute nail-biting.  When it comes down to brass tacks no fan should be left out in the cold; and no fan will be, after a quick stop by  The Office's  award winning website.   R,  The Office  CEO and all around live wire, has been larking about the office chanting, Its Bowl Game time, boys and girls.  Ever the avid fan, he added that, If we have to, well sell every ticket we have-- except mine!   The Office  already does brisk bowl game sales, with current figures hovering around $100,000 per bowl; at this rate, it looks to be another record breaking month in the millions for the Basement Crew.     The Office  also serves pre-bowlgame needs with a complete listing on their live online ticket buffet.  There are scads of football games left to be seen, and the easiest way to grab a slice of the pie is a quick stop at the  The Office's  homepage.  After all, those games arent going to watch themselves.   --Press Release, 2003  \n",

      "    Unexpected Sales Numbers for Rugby World Cup have Fans Scrambling  With a Month and a Half til Kickoff,  The Office  Sells over a $ Quarter Million   With a little over a month til Rugby World Cup 2003 kicks off in Sydney, fans worldwide are jumping on open seats for their favourite matches: the October 18th match, England v. S. Africa, is selling especially well as die-hard fans in the UK snap up tickets ranging anywhere from a $215 USD category B seat to the $350 USD category A spots.  The stadium in Perth, Australia is filled to capacity nigh two months out due to the popularity of the Club from England.  Who would have guessed such vigorous response so early in the year, but it has become obvious that now is the time to grab your favorite matches- before tickets disappear.   Match #38, Australia v. Ireland, is a red-hot match at  The Office , as the two clubs are expected to pitch a voracious battle-- and at an average $200 USD per seat who wouldnt fancy seeing these boys play.  This match is one in a long line of reasons Australia runs a close second to the UK in daily traffic across  The Office's  busy storefront.   In a shining example of faith and dedication many a Britisher have purchased Finals tickets, in expectation of England carrying the Cup.  The November 15th semis match is going for an average $475 USD, while those astute enough to grab their premium Finals tickets now, are only paying anywhere from $500 to $1000 USD.   R,  The Office  CEO, was caught saying that, Fan response this year is unprecedented, to the extent that, no one can afford to wait long as the rush for premium seating has turned into a full-on stampede of drooling, eager rugby Fans.  And the largest part of those eager fans calls the United Kingdom home; the rest of  The Office's  10,000 visitors a day hail from Australia, the Africas, and America.  With the unprecedented number of tickets sold, to the demographically largest fan base in the world, only one thing is certain: a rivalry on this order will make for the most exciting Rugby World Cup in living memory.        --Press Release, 2003  \n",

      "   I am close to getting what I want right now if only I could resist the pressure of cracking, of trying to mend broken dreams simply because I have learned to live always holding on to someone else; so that when the time comes to stand on my own a little while I deteriorate to emotional horseshit and cast about for whatever life preserver might be found, which always happens to be the latest in a long line of failed relationships.  That the new-- the mist shrouded mount afar off, the tug on my heart strings, the Challenge and the Glory-- will sustain and nurture my otherwise horseshit doesnt matter where my acquired dependency on third party emotions is concerned.  My life struggle, insofar as the term applies to this early breaking news sensation, seems to be finding the will power to move from one relationship to another. The only consolation I have in this particular case is the fact that though I am presently regressing, as is my manner, the relationship I'm moving into isn't a tried and failed one rather, it's one that was tried and then given a raincheck for more pressing matters.  In other words, the glimmer of half a chance awaits me at the end of this monotone rainbow, which makes for a far better shower than any I've previously endured. At this point I commence to dribbling on in broken english about the qualities of my current heart-lust and just what justifies us being together.

      "   S  There's something I've always wondered, and now one of my close friends is in the position to let me in on the answer. What exactly do married women with children do on Friday nights? I'm going to go out on a limb and suppose it's the same thing unmarried, twenty-five year old guys do-- try to tie up all the loose ends we call life. Twenty-five year old guys named Tony, that is-- Mea culpa. The nice man in the white jacket didn't feed me my vitamins this morning so I may come off as a wee bit wound up. I must admit, before we get much further, that I am an uninhibited email junkie of the free-love school when it comes to letter writing. That is to say, you're not the only one lucky enough to receive an email from Super T tonight. And although it doesn't make up for the social hole I've dug myself into, I am kinda starting to get into this editorially obtuse writing spree. Too bad a masculine version of The Vagina Monologues would never catch on. Oh wait, that's my day to day. It wouldn't be fair to say I'm a mysogynist, as I spread my angst and apathy fairly between the sexes. Misanthropic, sometimes, I admit-- but I'm working on it. I met a girl with whom it would never work out. I went out last night and talked in an Irish accent the whole night. Again. It's getting old (already) but let me tell you, hiding behind an accent does wonders for my social security. Really fills up the ol' chutzpah tank. The ability to create and use a character in public- Irish or otherwise- provides a certain element of security, a mask if you will, that allows one to do and say that which would otherwise be impossible. Tony could never be the boyishly charming, handsome devil that Irish-Tony-from-Dublin is. Well, everything but the handsome part. I have opened my eyes by shutting them.  Yes, I'm sober. Somber, even. And no, these guns aren't loaded. Guess you've realized by now that I'm playing Oedipus to your Oracle, and if you read this booger 'til the end you probably deserve a medal. There's a medal shortage on right now though, so I'll give you the next best thing: and end to this helter skelter email. Si quando in hic mundo bellam puellam invenit...Gloriem diam! Well, not sure about that last part. I was a lousy Latin student. You took Italian so you can probably get the gist of it, or at least the jest of it.    Arrivederci mi angelo,  T   \n",

      "   Ed.'s note: The following is from a letter written by a good friend, Stacy. Being a Woman Herself, she should know what she's talking about. It has been edited for punctuation but otherwise left verbatum.   Girls are all the same. Give her just a little bit of fun and attention and then pull back again. Keep her wanting more and not getting it. That drives girls wild. Then when you know she is ready to have you and sacrifice for you, give her the whole thing. That is a girl's weakness. She needs to be wanted and when she feels she isn't getting that she will strive to earn it. If she is already wanted she will wander off to find someone else to want her. We are evil. We all want something new and exciting, something we can't have, and something everyone else wants. That is the bottom line of the good guys finish last scenario. You can get a good guy, but it is harder to get a player and it seems like the player has a lot of other people wanting him. Now that doesn't mean a girl wants a jerk. She wants a challenge that will then melt in her hands and let her feel like she has some power. Ok, so we are complicated creatures that play a few more games then men do. Men are a little easier, they want someone that will be a lady and look like a trophy and is fun to do a lot of activities with that will then go home behind closed doors and be a total slut. So, I guess if a girl can accomplish all of that she would be a catch. Unfortunately a lady is never a slut and a slut can't pretend to be a lady for very long.  \n",

Stepping out for the imposing peak Traversing the vast and friendless plain;         Echoing that voice that he hears speak            Of good and gloom in long refrain.                     At the foot for to size Up the mount with weary eyes; Troubled is he by Wind that cries 'Turn ye back, word to the wise'!                   Strength's been depleted by ceaseless gale Toiling against rock has made him weak; Deafened by distraction's constant wail Unable to find the soft spot he seeks.  Sadness unchanged tho' sorely dogged Yet stays his soul against the strain; Many more difficulties must be logged Before the peak he hopes to gain.  Looks ahead- is demonstriz'd By bully Rock that belies What trouble beyond lies In the path to paradise.  Turning 'round there is nothing to see 'Tween heaven almighty and earth so frail; Neither rose nor red bends listening ear To what news of hardship his journey entails.               The mount, afar, bred hollow determination In a heart youthful and callously unfear'd; Now bravery's dethroned by resignation To lonely despair and it's manifest tear.  Heart now sterilized Rose thought crystallized The truth, come to realize Is looking up at the skies!  No recourse but push on towards a dream For dying alone brings not salvation; Even goodness, sometimes, is not what it seems When heading for the land of reonciliation.  Down to tall earth on still wind snow sails Lends to the silence an imperial theme; Drowsy, a tired traveler might hear it say 'Now sing you a lullaby- sing I your requiem.'  Hope is bent Soul is spent Curtain is rent Let me repent!  Sight gone with snow's soft silent regale On and on the path trips, winds its way; Rosy hope struggling- will it prevail? Against desperation's callous foray.  Presently the peak no longer daunts Across thick mist he barely can see Rocks, whose form on the shore haunt And past that his everbless'd salt sea!  It's apparent He was sent With intent Most fervent  As ocean, salt tears roll down his face Never a sight more joyous could be; Love lead to that which is now embrace'd The sight of his everbless'd salt sea.  In seas of change is Sadness epilogue'd First life, now death, each joyously faced Roses were right, in their dialogue Whispering pain, but speaking of grace.        \n",

      "   Rain softly spatters the pavement two stories below, beating a quiet, steady rhythm that is at once inspiring and depressing; how good it feels to see the world washed of its sin, to accept the tranquility imminently offered by nature's downpour and the heart's consequent outpour. But as the breast swells to the rinsing of the rain, what wasted chances in sunny days past are remembered!  The trickle, the stream, the rushing and gushing as soft silent drizzle drowns the floodgates of a memory burdened with its task of forgetting too slowly.  Love is a master of his craft, changing faces even with the changing faces of nature; the giddy child of this morning's bright-hot sunrise, the wizened elder that just this evening came knocking at your conscience; beating a quiet, steady rhythm- let me in, let me in- as you sit and listen to the rain.

      "   S,  I love how this world works if one allows it to. It's a quarter of eleven Sunday night and I checked my email thinking that I should write you because it's been so long since we've talked, I shouldn't neglect friends like that, and I know you don't write unless it's your turn. Well guess who shows up in my inbox. I am more than a little moved, as well as awestruck. Since we've been off of our daily routine, let me bring you up to speed: I spent four days worriedly cramming for my real estate exam, which I sat for and passed with flying colors last Tuesday morning; I've been engrossed in applications and interviews the past two weeks; in the middle of last week, after zero success in the job hunt, I came very, very near to selling everything I own to buy a sailboat in San Diego, move to Southern Cali maybe build houses for awhile to make money, then take off for Hawaii by way of Cabo San Lucas, where I have a contact. Well Thursday I scored an interview and an hour into it they made an offer I couldn't refuse. So as of Friday I work for the biggest real estate company in central Texas. Now that may sound like a lot, but my life has felt surprisingly slow these past couple days, which makes me wonder if it's the whole life-passing-before-my-eyes routine and I'm dying slowly-- maybe I shouldn't have postponed the dream just to stick my hand in the cookie jar. Considering in the last year and a half I've turned into a worrier extraordinaire, that kind of doubt makes for good bedtime contemplation. Oh and I got a cat. Named Cat. Or kitty-kitty, or stinkin' cat, or blackstuff, or whatever comes to mind when it goes to nibbling on my toes expecting breakfast at five. So you get a new schedule, an extra day off to work on the house and really put down roots, grow, whatever you want to call it, and 250 miles and a lifetime away, I pick up the slack and start working six days a week full time. There is a rhythm to this world-- you just have to stop listening so hard in order to hear it. Well Sunday is the day of rest and that's just what I've done. I don't feel particulary rich in the coin of the spirit, nor particulary poor. I'm not sure yet if I've done the right thing, but I've done something and that, when your name is Tony West, is most of the time all that you can ask. I Can't tell you, babe, how fine it is to hear from you, and I was honestly about to write! Now that you have more time, you should visit; and when I come to my senses and pull stakes for parts unknown I'll be sure to stop by and see you on my way out. Kinda like agreeing to get married at 25 if nothing else comes along. It was Herman Melville who said, 'Do not forsake the dreams of thy youth.' When I was young I had a new dream every week; happiness was doing it all. These days I wish I could do something- anything- productive, since happiness tends to be fleeting at best. And I may get the chance yet: all anyone has to do is stop listening so hard and let things happen. I promise I'll write more often.  Yours,  Tony   \n",

A butcher pulled me aside so we could have a picture together with his pig. We had lunch in a small place within the market where the smell continued to waft in and I had no appetite from all the sites and sounds. Before I knew it, a 40-something man there was asking Dr. Romanos permission to caress me so he bought us all wine and chicken and when we were leaving he handed me a dead fish, fully intact. I did not know what to do with it. His counterpart, who took our picture with his photo phone, had a toupee that was so warn it actually had a significant bald spot.

When we arrived to Santorini, we were treated to breakfast at a caf and driven to our absolutely enormous house. Two persons per room, each with its own bathroom and veranda. A new refrigerator, stove, clothes washer, and then yesterday, we came home to find our refrigerator completely packed, along with the cupboards, and the storage area. Our dining room was full of every item you would need to entertain a party of twenty. And to add to all of this, we got Susana, our cook and maid. We will be given the opportunity to spend each Saturday on a different island in the cyclades as guests of an official were working with.

But when we got into the city, it was so different. Everything is under construction for the olympics. Working on sidewalks, roads, and building fronts everywhere. And there are guards with rifles patrolling the large buildings (I think this is normal). We went to a taverna last night and had great food with wonderful wine, I think we were the only foreigners there.

      "       So I'm walking home from school today and guess who I see: Steve Ivcich.  Except it wasn't Steve Ivcich.  It was Steve Ivcich, just 15 years younger.  And he wasn't named Steve Ivcich.  This is yet again another example of me seeing someone who I know except just at a different age.  For example, last summer I did my community service hours at Ronald McDonald House, which is this place by Children's Memorial Hospital that gives free room and board to people who don't live in the area but don't know when they can return home because their kid has a disease, is badly injured, etc.  So the grounds kept at the Ronald McDonald house is named some name I can't remember, but I know his name wasn't Zandy.  Except the weird thing is that this guy looked EXACTLY like Zandy, except 30 years older.  Same voice, same face, same sense of humor, the whole 9 yards (speaking of 9 yards, I remember this conversation I had a while back about the origin of that phrase and is has something to do with escaping from prisons.)  So It's the present day, and yet their are two identical version of the same person(s), except they are of different ages.  And have different names.  Another example: So I have to go to get a hair cut cause my dad turns into a Fundamentalist when my hair gets to long so I had no choice but to cut it.  So I'm off to the Hair Cuttery, the one on Wells and Eugenie to be exact, and I go inside and put my name down and take a seat.  So I wait around 15 or so minutes and then this lady tells me to come back.  Now this ain't any ordinary lady, this is the one and only Chuck.  Yes, the Chuck from Narsty, the Chuck that's George's friend, the one we all only kinda know and yet still love.  Except once again, it isn't really Chuck.  It's Chuck all right, but 10 years older.  And she ain't named Chuck.  But other then those two recurring factors, they are one in the same.  They listen to the same frickin' music, and not only that, she even told me about how she went to the last Bad Brains concert, and how it sucked cause they played only their most famous shit and then a bunch of their Reggae/Rock/Jazz fusion stuff (Not that that has anything to do with Chuck herself, but it just shows that she has common sense.) If you haven't caught on yet, then let me put the bib on for ya (Red Lobster is overrated.) (like sushi.)  All of these examples and stories that I have just given you have one 'thing' in common.  This one 'thing' holds all the pieces of this mysterious puzzle together, and gives it its meaning.  This one 'thing' has somehow been able to take all of these stories and make them possible; this one 'thing' is the glue that holds the pizza pie to the plumber's ass. Until the moment this afternoon when I was walking home from school and I saw Steve Ivcich but I really hadn't, I had always wondered what the one special thing about this 'thing' really was.  I had always known this 'thing' to be this 'thing', and yet I always knew that this 'thing' had some other purpose, agenda, special thing about this 'thing' that always seemed to make weird things happen involving this 'thing' that no one could explain.  And then, after I passed the Steve Ivcich that wasn't Steve Ivcich, I realized what was the thing about this 'thing.' This 'thing' had the ability to warp our own ideas about people, and reshape them to give us a new understanding of these people.  These people are the ones I spoke of.  They were once but people I knew, but I didn't really know em'.  Now I don't exactly feel like I know know em', but I don't feel like a stranger.  And yet I have also realized that this 'thing' truly isn't someone different then ourselves.  This 'thing' in fact holds no superpowers at all, No exotic/erotic voodoo magic, No complex personality that people can't understand, in fact, the only extraordinarily Amazing Thing about This 'Thing' Is IT's BLINDing, CHAOS Causing, TUSUNAMI Trembling, ABSOLUTELY RAVISHING SEXINESS!  This 'Thing' is none other then George Ivcich. p.s. By Sexiness I mean [crowd whisper's in Nikesh's ear]... Sexiness          \n",

      "       I am now making a call to you all: (call meaning plead) Please tell people about this blog! Why you ask?  What's in it for me? A: What if I told you I would pay you to write for this blog if I could get enough daily visitors, more then just the people we know directly. Sounds good right?  To good to be true? Just take a look at www.Gizmodo.com That sight is owned by a guy who just lives off the advertisements on his weblog.  That's it. Well you say, why would anyone want to read this blog?  It sucks now anyway, no good or interesting readable content anyway. Fair enough.  But how about this:  what's the one thing that always holds my plans and ideas back from being carried forward?  The answer my friends is money. So what if I got enough money from the ads to finance my projects, and then I wrote about them in the blog?  People would sure as hell read that.  And then I could start putting up movies and pictures and eventually the traffic on the site would be so great that not only could I finance bigger projects, I could also turn in an actual profit from the blog.  By the way, the blog by this time would have a real webpage, not this free one I'm on now.  And then the I would become WE, and then WE could have simultaneous projects going on and it would be fucking crazy!  Pay your way through college, give you something to put on your resum, something to right your thesis on.  And now I want to address one issue that I think separates me and those who believe in my ideas from those who immediately cast them off and say, 'That aint gonna happen.'  Just think about what we could do.  Don't think about how were gonna get there, just think about how kick ass it would be when everything is set up and flowin'.  Just let the ideas flow, and don't let reality hold you back, cause reality is just what society makes you think is realistic.  There are no boundaries when it comes to these Ideas.  Yes, Ideas is capitalized.  Just fucking forget about how 'unrealistic' things are for once.  Let your imagination run wild in a field where everything you could possibly need to make your idea come true is at your fingertips.  'Realistic' is meaningless.  Welcome to my world.  Let your mind wonder and don't be afraid/ashamed/fell stupid to think about things that societydoesn'tt accept or you think other people will reject you for. That'ss the best part about thinking, cause no one can intrude on you or invade your privacy.  All your thoughts are personal and private, and most importantly, unrestricted.  This may sound like the same old bullshit they tell you in preschool except this actually has some value.  These ideas give you a new direction in life.  I can't tell you how many times I change my opinion on topics after thinking about them.  I'm like a supermodel going through Menopause.  Damn that's a good quote.  Niccolo Machiavelli once proposed, 'The ends justifies the means.'  No they don't, cause the means are always justified if the ends are productive and meaningful. Productive and meaningful you say?  How is a Rocket powered RadioFlyer productive or meaningful?!  Sentimental value.          \n",

      "       Another Lovely day on the way to drivers ed, sitting in the back of a bus with 14 other people where only 8 can fit, and Rush Limbaugh blaring on the radio.  I have to say, that if it was any warmer, I would have been in hell.  Rush Limbaugh?  The devil.  God?  Forget him.  Jesus?  Dead.  Fahrenheit 9/11 kicked ass.  I wish it had focused more on the false motives that led to the war in Iraq, but hey, its all good.  Music update: I was listening to the Bundu Boys after Andrew left on Friday, and I got to thinking...The world would be a better place if Americans listen to world music.  American music is always about an image, a philosophy, a motive, a feeling.  But world music is not like that.  World music is about music.  I like songs with a political message in em, but still; I like to just sit back and not give a shit every once in a while.  People are way to serious about things in this world.  And no, world hunger and war are not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about vanity and society: people are to self conscious and AFRAID that they'll fuck up in life.  Why do you think we have so much more homework as students now then our parents did 30-40 years ago.  They say we have to work harder, cause the world is more competitive now then it was before.  But that's because people don't sit back and say, 'Hey! Hey.....'  Today with live two lives: One in the present, and one in the future.  People are pressured into living in the future, by being forced to do hard work now, so that you'll do better in the future.  But what happens when that future gets here?  Then you need to talk about your 401k plan, how to invest for your retirement.  And what about when that future gets here, your retirement?  Then you think about your death, how your family is going to support itself, your will.  And then that future arrives.  What are you gonna plan after that?  Nothing.  To bad you realized on your death bed that instead of living in the future you could have spent your time in the present.  Cared for your family.  Had fun with your friends.  Loitered in the time you had, the time that never felt like it would run out.  Haven't people realized?  80 years is a long fucking time.  But what happens when you do live in the present only?  Well fucking look at me: 3 pills a day, a visit to the therapist once a week, a trip to the psychiatrist quarterly, and a piece of shit high school. And I wouldn't give that shit up for anything.

      "       I, SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE UNIVERSE AND ALL UNDERLINGS, NIKESH PATEL, HEREBY OPEN CASE FILE #38027-1: STUPID RULE OF SOCIETY #1: FORMAL CLOTHING  Formal clothing makes me sick.  Not only does it not serve any purpose whatsoever, it just makes everyone else's life chaotic and tense.  Not only has formal clothing changed our culture for the worse, I believe it could single handedly plunge our society back into the Dark Ages.  Now don't get me wrong, I still think penguin tuxes kick ass.  But I never said I hated clothing in general, I just hated 'formal clothing.'  A tux is just another article of clothing, which in theory should be worn just as much as any everyday t-shirt or pair of pants (minus the fact that they are next to impossible to clean and cost a fuck load of money.)  But affix the adjective 'formal' in front of clothing, and all hell breaks loose.  I will start first by addressing why so many people in our society disagree with me, and then why they are in fact mentally extinct dopes.  A large percentage of our population, predominantly middle-class families with some sort of religious faith, attends functions that require formal dress and would not question it in a heartbeat.  They believe that at these functions, such as weddings, bar/bat mitzvahs, and benefits, formal clothing is appropriate and it is rude not to wear it.  They do not want to appear shabby, rugged, or god forbid informal.  However, these people have yet to realize one fatal flaw with their reasoning: what is defined as shabby, rugged, or informal?  And by whom?  The answer to this, my underlings, is not only simple, it is written on captain obvious him selfs t-shirt.  Shabby, rugged, and informal clothing is defined by a persons perception of what society deems appropriate.  So if these people believe that society considers t-shirts, baggy pants and fishnet stockings shabby, rugged and informal, then whom did society get this idea from?  The answer to this, my feline friends, is human nature.  What?  Human nature?  What the fuck does the nature of humans have to do with why formal clothing is the bane of human civilization?  It has everything to do with it.  Humans are many things, but most importantly humans are greedy.  Oh wait you say, but I'm not greedy.  You may not think so, but greed is an essential part of human survival, and we would absolutely not be the dominant species on this planet if we weren't.  Oh hold it right there you accuse, I give my old clothes to homeless shelters and volunteer in my community.  Good for you I say, you should feel good about yourself.  But answer this question: Do you eat?  Of course you say, I eat because food is necessary for my survival.  And I say sure it is, but what about the child starving in the third world country with an economy that can barely support its corrupt government, doesn't that child need food to survive?  Or the homeless man outside your door and around the corner, sitting in his rain-soaked cardboard shelter: is food not necessary for his survival?  And you say yes, but it's unrealistic to give them my food, for I can't ship my dinner plate without the food spoiling, and plus it would cost too much anyway.  And the hobo down the street is high on crack anyway, so he doesn't want my food, and he smells anyway.  And I say to you, there, there is your greed.  And then you respond, but I give my $85, week-old cardigan to homeless shelters because they have gone out of fashion, and I give $5 to UNICEF on my yearly flight to Cancun, Mexico, where I spend 10 days at a beach resort, forgetting all my worries as I relax in a town where a town a few miles away 80% of the population lives below the poverty line.  And I say, there, there is your greed.  And you retort, well look at you!  Who ever said you were perfect, Mr. All high and mighty, steals from the poor and gives to the rich?!  And I say, no one.  No one ever said I was perfect, or any different than you.  No one said I was the Messiah, no one declared that I stood for all that is good and just.  And yet it is I that says, there, there is your greed.  And you scream to me, BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME!  Do you want me to run out into the rain, and treat the hobo as I would myself, and give him my own food?!  Should I vacuum-seal my dinner plate, and ship it to a boy in Mozambique?  Should I take the costs out my own paycheck, and send my tax refunds to the homeless shelter half way across town.  And I say no.  I say no because you are indeed correct, those things are unrealistic.  But what do I want from you?  I want you to admit that you are greedy, that you are human just like the rest of us, that greed is a key segment of human nature, that you and I are both physical embodiments of greed.  AND YOU YELL WITH FRUSTRATION, BUT WHAT DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHY FORMAL CLOTHING WILL EVENTUALLY BURY OUR CULTURE IN A BACKWARDS DOOM OF CHAOS AND CORRUPTION IF IT IS NOT ELIMINATED?!  And I say, damn bitch hold your fucking horses, I haven't even gotten to the point yet.  Let's recap: society got the idea that t-shirts, baggy pants and fishnets are shabby, rugged and informal from human nature.  Human nature is reflected through our actions as humans, and humans are greedy.  This means that human nature has a pure element of greed.  So how did the greed in human nature define what clothes are considered informal, rugged and shabby?  The questions, my dear Watson, is not how the greed in human nature defined certain clothes as informal, rugged and shabby, but rather how the greed in human nature made a separation between formal and shabby, rugged and informal clothing in the first place, and for what purpose.  So first we must ask ourselves why the greediness in humans would want to establish a concept of formal and informal clothing.  Chew on this: Can greed be greedy for greed?  Let me put it in context: a businessman is the head of a relatively large company, with a great deal of capital potential.  Let's take the one and only Enron for example.  The businessman is the CEO of Enron, the head hancho, the king of the hill, the full Monty, the big l mooch.  However, he lives in a moderate sized house, in a normal, middle-class neighborhood in the city.  His kids go to public school and his wife works part time at the local preschool.  He is greedy in the sense that he makes sure that he claims enough resources for himself so that he can keep his family living comfortably without many worries, whether those be financial or safety-wise.  But at a primal level, greed is always something that strives for more.  So let's say that the businessman somehow comes to a point where he is offered a lucrative set of stock options, ones that are sure to have high returns.  Now the businessman's primal greed starts to take over.  He now wants more money, a more lavish life style, a penthouse downtown, a Bentley and a private jet, a hot secretary to fuck on the side.  But in order to get these wishes of his, he must lose his morality and ethics and make decisions that will ruin other people's lives.  This is the question: Can the business man's greed actually strive for more greed, so that it can reach those goals, or can the business man's greed be greedy enough to make those decisions on its own?  Or can the man's greed be greedy enough to make others greedy for him, and then make the decisions to cover up his ass.  Can his greed be greedy at all?  Is this question fundamentally flawed?  The answer to these questions are open to interpretation, however the bottom line is that the business man has the ability to move from his current moral high ground to the corrupt corporate scoundrel that we all know of.  And this is where everything else comes into play.  The founders of our society were men like these.  And by founders I do not mean our Founding Fathers, no.  Thomas Jefferson was long dead by the time our cultures real founders started making changes.  The founders of our society were corporate shmucks.  They didn't give a hoot about the future, except along the lines of financial prosperity.  They wanted more, and they used our society to get it.  It was these founders that introduced the ideas that shaped our society's ideas of formal and informal clothing.  Why?  In order to understand this, we must first understand the affects formal clothing has had on our society.  One anomaly that you might have run into already is that formal clothing is not something recent.  Formal clothing has been around since the days when feudalism still was the way of the land in Europe, and chivalry was still livin' strong.  In reality, formal clothing was even more predominant back then than it is now.  But when I say that the idea of formal clothing in our society originated with big business, I mean the new meaning of formal clothing.  This meaning, what I shall call the purpose of formal clothing, is what I hate.  It is the new purpose of formal clothing, the one created by big business, which has screwed over our culture.  Screwed over?  What the fuck does he mean by screwed over?  What I mean by screwed over is how formal clothing has fundamentally changed how our society functions, and why our culture is only suffering from these changes.  Let me break this issue down into 3 easy to swish-and-spit sections: 1.) Past Motives 2.) Present Affects 3.) Future Implications Shall we start in order...  Le Numero Uno: Past Motives The motives of the founders of our society not only had many clear and precise long-term goals, they also had a whole slew of short-term objectives that they kept in mind when introducing their new interpretation of formal clothing.  What was their interpretation of formal clothing?  To them, formal clothing was a tool they could use to manipulate large percentages of the population, and implement new and lasting cultural paradigms.  Big business, i.e. the founders of our society, were as smart as they were exploitive.  They reshaped our idea of formal clothing not all at once in one large brainwashing scheme, but over a period of time where it would go more or less unnoticed.  They introduced their 'tool' into American society during key changing points in our culture.  The most recent of these introduction periods was during the Great Depression.  We all know that big business leased huge sums of money to the government, and in doing so bought themselves a small part of our country.  How small?  Where?  I, ladies and gentlemen, am talking about a 1/8 of the little place we call Washington D.C.  They bought power in our government, and used it to make small changes in this country.  What were these small changes?  That remains a mystery, as only big business knew what they themselves were up too entirely.  However, their motives were known.  What did they want formal clothing to do for them?  First of all, formal clothing could pressure the middle class, as well as the lower classes, into holding themselves to a standard that was set by the upper class.  By this I mean that in the old old old days, all the rich people ALWAYS wore formal clothes.  There wasn't an alterative.  Now, with formal clothing as a required commodity at important functions, people in the lower/middle classes began to hold themselves to this same standard, that only the noble and well off dressed in their formal clothes, and to walk into a ball in jeans and a t-shirt made you look like a 'ruffian,' a no good lowlife.  big business likes this mentality, and they can use it to their advantage.  Wait a second, Modesty?  What about MTV and whore like... well, whores!  Let's travel back in time to a little period called the Elizabethan Era.  Now, what was one thing that women did back in this time?  They covered their bodies from chin to toe in clothing.  Nothing could show, except for the front of the face and MAYBE the hands (gasp!)  Why did they do this?  Cause previously, people had been runnin' around with their clothes practically flyin off, and modesty was shot to hell.  And eventually people became disgusted with it and decided that everything must go: No more public orgies, multiple wives, scantly clad clothing, Michael Jackson... the list goes on.  And this created a cycle.  Eventually people got mad because of all the conservative influences that were taking the fun out of life, so people started showing more skin again.  Now, what is better for a business financially: being able to predict trends in society, or being able to predict trends in society?  Not only could the business profit off these trends, they could guarantee that it would happen over and over again!  So, you ask, how does formal clothing create this trend?  As I said before, formal clothing instilled ideas in our heads of what is and isnt appropriate in certain situations.  Eventually these ideas became intertwined and swing either way, which dictates the current phase of the trend we are in.  If the formal clothing idea swings into that of what is informal, then we have a new conservative ear in our culture.  If it goes the other way, then sex is in.  Now, we all know that adults do not dictate these trends single handedly, no sir-ree.  This is where the youth come in.  The adults are the people who begin the initial swing, but it is the youth that carries it out.  If the youth are liberal horny sex machines, then the adults become more conservative.  Since the adults control the government and society, they push a conservative, modest influence into society.  Then the adults die off, and the youth become the adults, and their children become the next youth.  However the conservative influence remains from the previous adults, the new youth grow up in this conservative lifestyle.  Then this generation of youth gets fed up with the censorship, and introduces liberal reforms.  This process repeats, and we have the trend that big business profits off of.  Let me also get it straight that this trend does not occur as quickly as I just explained it.  This cycle repeats maybe once, twice, even possible three times at the most during a century.  Big business could still use this to their advantage, by controlling the media to keep the trend going, and even make it stronger.  These, my underlings, were the factors that motivated the founders of our culture to introduce their spin on formal clothing.  Le Numero Dos: Present Affects I'm scared.  Not only am I scared, I am empowered.  It is the threat that is currently facing our generation that has empowered me.  I cannot sit here, twiddling my thumbs without thinking how fast our culture is going down the toilet, and yet nobody seems to care.  Adults Are Oblivious, Children Are Ignorant, politicians are happy.  Not All politicians, But The Ones Who Choose To Ignore The Threat Of Our Impending Doom.  Our society is in a headlock, crippling under the pressure of Gun-Ho fuckers without a sense of future.  Hello, were not in faking Kansas anymore.  We never WERE in goddamn Kansas.  Fuck Kansas.  The word Kansas really looks like a piece of shit word too after you stare at it for a while.  Let me indulge you on the current destructive forces milling at our society.  We are headed into another turn of the knob.  Yes, the other phase of the trend.  The omens are everywhere you look: MTV, national thong sales, George Bush, gay marriage, the war in Iraq- these things all add up to one thing; conflict.  And when we hit conflict, all goes to hell.  We are living in a liberal society for the most part, in terms of cultural ideals.  But that is quickly changing.  BAMM! The Supreme Court puts George Bush in office.  BAMM! Enron collapses.  BAMM! 9/11 scares the suburbanites shitless.  BAMM! Bush lies to Americans to get revenge on the guy who tried to assassinate his daddy.  BAMM! Janet Jacksons tit falls out during the Super Bowl.  BAMM! Clear Channel drops Howard Stern after being fined by the FCC.  BAMM! Malpractice insurance rates driving doctors out of business because of frivolous lawsuits.  BAMM! Emeril adds some more butter; the U.S. gets fatter.  WAKE UP AND SMELL THE GASOLINE FOLKS!  Oh wait, THERE ISN'T ANY!  We are returning to the Conservative agenda that screwed over our country years ago, and American is just letting it slide right fucking by.  Formal Clothing has given a medium for the conservative media to exploit us.  FOX NEWS! GETTIN THE CONSERVATIVE BLUES!  While the Catholic Church rapes your brother and NOBODY GIVES A SHIT!  MAYBE ONCE THEY SEE THE SHIT ON HIS FACE THEY'LL START CARIN'!  And Despite these horrible realities, there is still hope.  Howard Dean kicked ass, except he wouldn't have gotten elected.  Michael Moore is the shiznit, but that whole Disney thing was kinda shabby.  WHERE IS RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE WHEN WE NEED THEM!  Change is possible, but it takes work, time, balls, guts, Benjamins, and a face.  If we don't start making changes soon, then in 60 years when were old and shriveled we'll have to say, 'Yep, formal clothing led to the downfall of our society.'  How pathetic is that.  Le Numero Tres: Future Implications The systematic brainwashing of our society led by formal clothing must be stopped.  If we do not band together to fight this greater evil, then it will lead our culture into a new Dark Age, where all of the progress we have made in recent years will be lost.  How?  The Question my underlings is not How is it going to destroy our society, for that is quite obvious.  The Question should be, What can we do about it?  But considering Ive already written this much itll probably take me a couple more days to explain this part.  So instead, I will answer the How questions.  How will it lead us into a Dark Age.  Let me lay it out for ya'.  As our society becomes more conservative, people will begin to where formal clothing everywhere, not just at important functions.  So whats the big deal. you say.  The big deal is that suddenly the control factor is gone.  Before, big business always dictated the trend of liberalism to conservativism in our culture.  But not fashion trends.  But you, you say, fashion trends change with current political trends, like how scantly-clad clothes are more popular during liberal times, while turtle necks and collars are more common in conservative times.  I say sure, but wait a second.  Formal clothing, unlike all other common clothing that we wear today, carries along an impression with it.  People think that formal clothing separates them from the rest of the masses, that for the time they are wearing it they suddenly have some higher importance.  These ideas have lasted through trends, and do not dissolve.  So if formal clothing becomes everyday clothing, then these ideas will become everyday also.  But hold up, you say.  Why hasn't formal clothing become the dominant choice for common clothing before?  Because we never had a chance to stick with it.  Think back: World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam.  But not Iraq.  Why not?  Because of terrorism.  Terrorism is a threat to our nation that people can't comprehend, so instead they leave it up to their leaders. Mr. President, why is my daddy dead?  Because he realized how great his country was, and that he was willing to do anything to make sure that the people of his country and you would live better lives.  But why is he dead Mr. President?  I dont understand.  Well son, your dad was fighting some very bad, evil people.  These people threatened this country.  They threatened him, her, them, this people of this city, of this entire country- and you.  And you were the most important thing to him, so he decided to fight to the end, just for you.  But whom was he fighting?  People who hate freedom son, people who don't understand what is so great about life here in America.  Where are they?  Did he make them go away?  Well son, these people are everywhere, and your dad was fighting a group of them.  There are so many, that this country has to draft your older brother to fight too.  Just for you, son.  Just for you.  but when will they go away Mr. President, when?  When they realize how great freedom is.  That's when.  And when will that be?  Soon son, soon.  What can I do to help?  Ha-ha, well your only 5.  You'll have to wait another 13 years if you want to enlist.  But when your old enough, I'm sure you'll know what the right thing to do is.  But what can I do now?  I wanna to help now!  Stay alert son!  If you see anything that doesnt look right, then tell an adult.  Do your part now, and you could save millions of people lives, just like your dad.  Gee thanks Mr. President!  I almost forgot that my dad died in a war that didn't have a clear enemy, goal or purpose!  I can't wait to sacrifice my life for a lying, manipulating bastard like yourself when I'm old enough!  But until then, I'll just pretend I live in late 18th century France and your Maximilien Robespierre, and instead of this being the War on Terror, it's the Reign of Terror!  And its my job as a responsible citizen to make sure I tell the government whenever some talks bad about you, Mr. President, because your just a good person and they don't believe in freedom if they don't like you!  I love my country! Do you want the next youth generation to grow up like this?  In our modern world, when people willingly decided to do stupid shit like this, and embrace conservative values, formal clothing reign supreme.  It will rise up, unstoppable because it is imposed on our society not by big business, which can moderate it, but by ourselves.  If formal clothing becomes commonplace, so will conservative values.  The Church will gain power, scientific progress will end, and military progress will proceed.  The remnants of the fun culture that we lived by, the truly free culture, will all but disappear.  And society will pause in progress, and begin to reverse.  Everything that we learned, our computer technology, our world connectivity, our world languages, our writing, our knowledge, our freedom, will undo itself.  We will forget everything, leaving nothing but uniformity and a homogenous society.  The freedom that we attempted to preserve will be gone.  Nothingness will become everything.  This, ladies and gentle men, I call the Tivo Affect.   I have shown you how formal clothing came about as a tool of big business in our culture, how it affects us today, and how it is gradually unwinding the delicate thread of our civilization.  And if I could replace the mindset that governs formal clothing in the brains of people, I would replace it with this new logic:  End the homogeneousness.  Do not strive to be the same; leap to be different.  Embrace the eccentric, outcast the followers.  Do not call people Posers, cause the only Posers are the people that call people Posers (-the words of Mark Gonzales).  Individuality is the answer, not the reject idea.  Fuck the stiff.  Love the new.  And don't forget to pimp out in those penguin tuxes.          \n",

Not that it ever was or is today, but the whole idea of any one person or group having control over a large amount of something that isn't their's is fundamentaly flawed.  As of matter of fact, control itself is meaningless.  This is no epiphany, but think about it.  If someone says they control the town over there, where towns people live and do business, what puts them in control.  If someone twists your arm and tells you to suck it, or puts a gun to your head and tells you to give 'em the money, how are they in control.

One day, this duck went to see his uncle.  When he saw his uncle outside his house fishing, the duck quacked, 'Uncle!'  The little duck's uncle looked up and saw his nephew, and greeted him with open wings.  Then a hunter shot the uncle.  And so the little duck ran back to his home and called the FBI.  Soon a crime seen was setup where the shooting had occured.  Apparently this was not the first shooting, and the FBI was already hot on the tail of the renegade hunter.  And so the FBI asked Congress to pass a bill that would require all citizens to have an I.D. card, that they must carry with them at all times.  This way, the FBI could track down the hunter easier.  Soon the FBI needed mroe help, and called the CIA.  They put a spending bill through Congress as part of the Department of Defenses 'Black Budget' that would allow them to tap and record all phone, mail, and electronic forms of communication without authorization.  Soon the FBI caught the hunter, and publicised the story widely, to gain public support for the agency.  However, even though renegade hunters were not at large and crime rates were down to an all time low, the FBI and CIA asked Congress to repass the old bills.  Congress did as they were told, fearing that questioning the bill would cause them to loose public support in the next election.  And so the little duck grew old, and soon he became an uncle as well.  But he was run over by a semi on I-94, and was squashed like a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich in a second graders lunch.

      "             Well, the 9-11 Commission is at it again, and today, Rudy Giuliani was on the menu.  For the most part, the overly critical bunch of hypocrites on the panel were pretty polite to the once hero of the day.  The real story here is the families of the victims of the tragedy.   'My son was murdered because of your incompetence!' shouted Sally Regenhard, whose firefighter son died in the trade center. Seated three rows behind Giuliani, she jabbed her finger at the former mayor and waved a sign that read 'Fiction' as he gave the city's emergency response a glowing review.   This woman, obviously saddened by her loss fails to realize that her son, in fact, died because terrorists flew planes into buildings - not because of the Mayor's incompetence.  This woman seems to have forgotten that Giuliani didn't fly any planes into any buildings, and that's the problem with a lot of people in America right now.  Everyone is so hung up in the politicization of this that they have forgotten who the real enemy is.     The report (The commission released two reports that mark the most comprehensive probe to date of New York's response on Sept 11) led to an aggressive interrogation of Giuliani's top fire, police and emergency management officials Tuesday, with Republican appointee John F. Lehman, a former Navy secretary under President Reagan, calling the failings 'a scandal' and 'not worthy of the Boy Scouts.'   Lehman told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the comments were misunderstood and that he was not trying to criticize those who led the Sept. 11 effort.   This seems to me to be a pretty cut and dry statement, and I think it's pretty clear who Lehman was talking about here.  If he wasn't trying to criticize those who led the effort, then who was he talking about?  Who was involved in a scandal?  Who's not worthy of the Boy Scouts?  We need to get to the bottom of this!  If it wasn't police, firemen, and local officials he was talking about, then who was it?  I want to know what could possibly be misunderstood from that.    The bottom line here is that this guy, just like the rest of these back-peddling pinheads, is trying to put on a show for the cameras.  They want to point the finger, and use powerful words like 'outrage' and 'disgrace' without the backbone  to take responsibility for anything themselves.   Later, Giuliani was chastised by members of the public. A longtime city gadfly berated him and the commission, yelling, 'Three thousand people murdered does not mean leadership!' He and another person were hustled out of the room.    Others in the audience shouted about the failure of Fire Department radios, shouting, 'Talk about the radios!   It's obvious why this guy was hauled out of the room.  What leadership could the mayor have possibly been able to provide in the midst of this disaster that would have prevented the loss of 3000 lives?  Again, a sad case of misguided anger.  He should be upset at the leadership of those who want to destroy our way of life, not those who serve to protect it.  I also have not heard anything to the effect that Giuliani, or anyone on his staff for that matter, built the radios that the fire department uses.  How quickly we forget about the communications nightmares of that day.  The trade towers had gobs of antennas on top of them.   Cell phones up and down the east coast were down, along with local telephones, cable, and yes, radios.  I can't wait for these people to start filing lawsuits against Motorola for wrongful death.  In my opinion, the mayor did a tremendous job managing this disaster, and should be commended.  I wouldn't have traded places with him for anything, and I doubt that anyone else in this country would have either.  Anyone who lived through Sept. 11th has now, essentially, lived in two different worlds.  Hindsight is 20/20, and I don't see what good it's going to do for this commission to sit and look for a scapegoat in our government.  Just like Pearl Harbor, this has changed the way we think, and so we must change the way we act.  Nobody wants another three thousand of our brothers and sisters to die.  We can't lose sight of who is at fault here.  The final report that this commission generates will not save a single life.  The only thing at this point that can save lives is the extermination of these radical Islamic pests, and paperwork and commissions can't do that - our military  can .

      "         Dead End    (3 1/2 SK)    The fact is Im a sucker for a bad movie. If I can sit down and watch a bad film with terrible acting and a predictable plot, Im usually a happy camper. That said, I do have standards. I need to be entertained. There is pulpy enjoyment level that can be achieved by an entertainingly bad film.   Somewhere between incomprehensible and mediocre, these very bad entertaining films lie.  Urban Legends  or  Deep Blue Sea  are films who take logic into their own hands and the world around them abides. It is the Michael Myers factor (the killer from the  Halloween  films). No matter how fast you run, Michael will be right behind you, if not in front of you, and it is that sort of relation to reality which Im getting at.  That said,  Dead End  starring Ray Wise and Alexandra Holden, is not an entertaining bad film in any sense of the word. Oh, it is a bad film, but not an entertaining one. It falls into the category just beyond affectionately bad: Actually Bad.   I get ahead of myself. The film has a plot, a long and excruciating plot. It involves a family that is going to Christmas Eve dinner at Grandmas house. Theyre late, and while the family falls asleep in the car, the father decides to take a shortcut. Soon after, he falls asleep. He wakes up just in time to avoid a car accident. Suddenly, weird and mysterious things start to happen.  Ok, how is it bad? In creative writing courses the first rule is you never end with: and then he woke up.  Dead End  breaks that rule. The film doesnt even have the decency to give its characters the deaths they deserve, or even show them die at all. Which screams of low budget filmmaking. Literally.  I have nothing against low budget filmmaking, The  Evil Dead  films are greater for their budgetary shortcomings. Sam Raimi and cohorts used this obstacle as a means of inspiration. But inspiration is foreign to this project.  All the deaths occur miraculously off screen, and when the family happens upon the dead relatives, there is never a shot of the remains, only reaction shots. While the use of the reaction shoot or cut aways from the violence works in many films (just watch the ear cutting scene in  Reservoir Dogs ) it does not work here.   Why? To start, the film never builds up the credibility to make the horror seem real. It never seems that anyone is in danger. There are times when the film builds a small sense of suspense but the audience is more relieved that shocks come at all.  There are other things that puzzle me about the plot:   By the end, the audience is suppose to believe that certain things have happened and others did not. This leaves the audience questioning everything about the plot, which in this case is not a very good thing. Things I wondered about: Were any of the family secrets actually revealed? Were these just the psychosis of main character? Who green lit this project?  Other bad choices:  Dead End  introduces a character, the Lady in White, and misuses her vengeance to the point of stupidity. Passing on the fact that she is one of the most ineffective villains in recent memory, the film never elaborates on why, when she had the chance, she did not kill everybody?  *Spoiler Alert* I am assuming that I will be the only person who saw this film or is going to see this film, so I really dont have a problem ruining the end.   Everyone dies in a car accident, the same car accident that the film misleads you to believe they avoided. This is where the Lady in White comes from; she was a passenger in the other car who also dies. When this is revealed, it comes across as head slappingly stupid. What the film wants you to believe is that the Lady is killing these innocent people, when in fact shes killing her murders.   It is not as if the concept is flawed, just the execution. By the time that this revelation occurs, the audience is far beyond caring.   Furthermore, the characters are attributed with personal histories that do not add up to anything. Its as if the filmmakers pulled characteristics out of hat. Why is it that the pot smoking son has a better grasp of reality than the psychiatrist daughter? Is that a social comment? If so, why kill him and spare the daughter?  The filmmakers do not seem to understand the effects of drinking or smoking pot. In this film, smoking pot is similar to morphine, and drinking does not impair you ability to drive.   Dead End  is the type of film that you can hear the filmmakers talking about how the audience missed the hidden meaning. Maybe we did, but I do not think I want to have them explain it to me.  *Note* As Ive already explain, I love bad films. So I knew what I was getting in for when I rented  Dead End , for it had no theatrical release in Ireland, though it was made in France, with American actors. Why would it have been made with American actors in France, you might ask? And it would be a good question. My thought is that Ray Wise, who starred in  Twin Peaks , is probably a sort of cult figure in the same way that David Lynch is in France.      \n",

      "       Films Reviewed:      The Day After Tomorrow           (2 SK)    Van Helsing   (2 1/2 SK)    Troy   (3 SK)     Now to the bad: 1.  Van Helsing  (or, WHAT?)  2.  Troy  (or, God Damn It!) 3.  The Day After Tomorrow  (or What Happened to Europe?)  Out of these three bad movies, only Roland Emmirchs  The Day After Tomorrow  seems like somebody on board was willing to ask the important questions, such as: Why are we making this film? or Who really wants to give two and half hours of their life for this? or Maybe we should have Eric Bana act by himself and then well enter a digital representation of Orlando Bloom in Post-Production?          I really disliked all of these films, but Ill spare  The Day After Tomorrow  for now... expect to say, What happened to Europe? I mean, we get Japan and some English guys in the Atlantic not to mention the scene in New Deli where its snowing, but what about Europe? Apparently, they didnt notice. Or were on their lunch breaks. (Having lived here now for a year, I can say that they do take long lunch breaks, so perhaps...) Maybe they just gave up? Look, they might have said if they have been given screen time, a huge snow storm is coming. Shit. Well, Im not moving until Ive finished my tea! Or something.  Oh, one more question: What about the weather in New Deli? At the Climatologists seminar in New Deli, it is snowing, yet only a reporter comments on this fact. I find it strange that a room full of weathermen dont find it remarkable enough to mention this little gem. Not Dennis Quaid, not Ian Holm. It might have come in useful in that whole, the-climate-is-changing-and-were-all-gonna-die scenario they find themselves in later.  Anyway, back to more important crap:  Van Helsing . Please keep in mind that Im a fan of both  The Mummy  and  The Mummy Returns , but not  Van Helsing . Stephan Sommers, the director of all three of these films, had a sort of absurd glee in  The Mummy  films. That glee has been lost here.   It has been replaced by a film that assembled all the waste of other bad movies, and made a pie. A crap pie. And who wants to eat crap pie?  There is one good thing about the film. The cinematography is very good. The matching of CGI and human action is, for the most part, very good. But the film makes the worst mistake in all action films that use CGI: an all-CGI final fight sequence! Id rather have the bone crushing goodness of  Kill Bill vol. 1  than watch CGI critters smack each other in a fight scene that make the  WWE  seem realistic.   This doesnt even begin to touch the problem with casting. What was Hugh Jackman thinking? Well, I know what he was thinking, but how did he believe that this film would actually help his career as an action hero. He was better in  Kate & Leopold . Hes good as Wolverine, but very, very bad as Van Helsing. He delivers his lines as if hes acting in another dimension. Im reminded of the  Mystery Science Theatre 3000  episode, in which the hero holds a befuddled look when held in close-up, to which the hecklers (the robots and Mike) scream Help me, Im stuck in another dimension. I believe this same principal applies to Hugh Jackman in this movie.  He is so out of sync with the tone of the Sommers film that it becomes distracting. As for the tone, only one actor gets it right: Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. You may remember Roxburgh as the evil prince from  Moulin Rouge  or the Dougray Scotts sidekick in  Mission Impossible II . He is a phenomenal character actor, in the fact that you could see him again and again and only kind of recognize him from the last part that you saw him in. Here he nails the ludicrous nature of the part, half over acting and half measured. Such a good performance is wasted in a film like this.  But such is the fate in a film as uneven as this. When action sequences are overshadowed by the acting of the villain, then youre in trouble.   Speaking of being in trouble,  Troy  is full of so many errors, that it never seems to get on the right footing. From the very beginning, when Achilles is late for war, the film seems doomed to failure. (What!?! Achilles is late for war? The guy is full of rage and fury, two things, that if Im not mistaken, dont allow for peaceful sleep.)   The only item of praise could be Eric Bana as Hector, but even he is saddled by the ineffective Orlando Bloom. As Paris, Bloom shows no signs of waking from the slumber that has affected him since the  Lord of the Rings  trilogy ended. In fact, I would wager a guess that Bana would have had a better time acting without Bloom standing next to him. If Bloom had been added in post to the scene in which he was required, the other actors might have had a better time of it. (In this scenario, it would have been fun to place different sized Blooms all over the film. In scenes where his services werent even required, as a sort of game: Wheres Orlando? But that would have required a sort playfulness that these filmmakers entirely lack.)  The other faults are so numerous that its better just to make a list:  1. Brad Pitt as Achilles. Pitt is a fantastic modern actor, but thats it: hes a modern actor. He is too nuanced and subtle to play a man of rage. The part would have been better played by someone like Stellan Skarsgrd or a young Nick Nolte, someone capable of broad strokes.  2. The CGI. I would rather watch a million crabs walk on a deserted beach than watch another mass of CGI warriors do battle in an epic film.  3. Julie Christie as Achilles mother. Wasnt Achilles mother a God? Christies scene is so bizarre that omitting it would have been better, a theme I would have liked to introduce to the entire film. Anyway, everyone knows Achilles story, why do we need anybody to tell us that hes doomed to immortality if he goes to war. Or if you dont know it, for whatever reason, why have it ruined by such a crappy scene?  4. Where are the Gods? I mean, come on. If youre gonna spend this much time on developing the story of Achilles and the Greeks, why arent the Gods introduced as an important part of life?  5. Why is everyone white? Troy is located in the Middle East, and yet its populated by Western Europeans. Are we so short on African-American or Arabic-American actors that we have to populate the film with white guys with dark hair? Come on, you could throw the Wayans family a bone. This question of course opens a bigger question, which I dont wish to address here.  Troy is over two hours long, and now Ive wasted a page of clean paper on discussing it. Thats quite enough.        \n",

      "       *A reminder. The  Sarcastic Kitten  system of film reviews is the reverse of most starring systems. The less you get, the better you did. Films are graded zero to four.*   Films Reviewed    Japanese Story     (1 SK)    Mean Girls   (1/2 SK)     The summer so far... has been a disappointment. There havent been any exuberant or awe-inspiring spectacles that have littered the cinemas to this point, instead weve been entertained by the less than original melodramas of  Troy ,  Van Helsing  and  The Day after Tomorrow . (As of now, Ive yet to see  Shrek 2  or  Spiderman 2  because they have not arrived on this side of the Atlantic.)   This is not to say that Ive bided my time on less than worth-it films. On the contrary, Ive seen good films but not the kind of popcorn fare that one wishes to find in the summertime.    Japanese Story , a film from New Zealand starring Toni Collete, was a good surprise. Its ending lacked the punch that the film deserved, but Collete and her costars brought depth to their characters and believability to the situations.   June also saw the release of  Mean Girls . Out of all the films Ive seen this summer,  Mean Girls  is by far the best. It sounds kind of dumb, I know, but  Mean Girls  powered by the very talented Lindsey Lohan, is very good.   It suffers from the same lack the  Japanese Story  does, neither seem to know the best way to end the film. Not a problem they share alone. It is probably the hardest thing to do: end the story right. Becoming so invested in the characters and the film, sometimes the writers/directors/stars fail to see the best way out.   SPOILER ALERT! *I promise that the following comments on the ends of these films will not destroy the enjoyment of seeing them.*    Japanese Story  overstays its welcome. It becomes too heartfelt and loses its objectivity. The film, until the end, keeps its distance, so that the audience can judge the characters for themselves. In the conclusion, it tells the audience how to feel about them. By that time the audience already knows. It comes across as if the director didnt believe that the audience could fully commit to the emotion that they(the director) felt it deserved, so they employed the over used technique of musical manipulation to help to underscore their points. A technique that in lesser films fills the audience with pseudo-emotional ties, but in this film comes across like the director doesnt trust the audience with the information that theyve been given.   This is not to say that objectivity is better than the subjectivity, manipulation has always been the Cinemas primary job. It simply would have been a better film if it had stuck to one theme.   Sticking to its theme would have helped  Mean Girls  as well. It starts off as a commentary on social structure of High School, and it is in good hands until the last act, when moralizing gets the upper hand. I understand why it moralizes. It is a film for teenagers and Lohans primary audience is in fact seventeen-year-olds. My problem is that Im 26, and looking for the level beyond. That is my problem, not the films (a fact that Ill reiterate until Im dead, if thats what it takes to get my point across). Its not  Heathers , but it is  Bring it On . I believe that if the film had ended differently, that it might not be as good a film.           I know thats contradictory.           I think the filmmakers (Mark Waters, director and Tina Fey, writer) knew exactly what they were doing and that what they wanted came out in the final product, but it still left a bitter taste in my mouth. Specifically, Waters and Fey want a film that is marketable to teenagers. While theyll happily take adults money, they arent interested in opening up a discussion about High School. The easiest way to do this is end the film happily; no moral ambiguity. This is where it becomes contradictory. I think the film is right in doing this, it is not af is the filmmakers were striving to make another  Elephant . As in Waters previous film,  Freaky Friday , hes made good entertainment for parents and children. Unlike  Freaky Friday ,  Mean Girls  does not allow for conversation once the audience walks out of the theatre.         \n",

      "         Intimate Strangers (Confidences trop intimes ) (Zero SK)    It is really hard to classify a Patrice Leconte film properly. They dwell in the gray area between bad French films and wondrous character studies.    It is not accurate to say that his films are an acquired taste; the taste is already there if you like to go to the cinema. It is more accurate to say that you will like them if you let yourself. Lecontes films are films that wander into the stories and take their time once there. Mostly, his films will not accept an outside agenda.   What this all breaks down to is that his films are complete, confident works. They are crafted and completed exactly the way that he wanted them.    Intimate Strangers  is a great example of this. The film works like all of Lecontes films: characters meet, find that they have something in common, and try to examine what it would be like if their life was a little different.   Very little happens in the way of convetional storytelling, there are no reversals or recognitions. Everything is more or less, as it seems. Still, the story and objectives of the characters are clear, without being straight forward. Leconte deftly uses the MacGuffin, a concept that Hitchcock used, in which the main action of the piece is skewed by an item of importance that all the characters would kill for.   Where in Hitchcock the MacGuffin would be classified information or a missing package, for Leconte, the MacGuffin is the intentions that the characters bring in the room.   In  Intimate Strangers , Anna (Sandrine Bonnaire) wanders into what she believes is her psychiatrists office and sits down Monsieur Faber (Fabrice Luchini) to tell him her problems. He is not her psychiatrist, but a tax lawyer.   This, eventually, comes to light, and still Anna visits Faber. Why she continues to visit the lawyer, tell him her problems, and disturb his work life, are what the main structure of the film hangs on and the MacGuffin.   These scenes, between Luchini and Bonnaire, are wondrous. Leconte and his cinematographer Eduardo Serra, let the camera hang on the characters, drifting around necklines and mouths like a kiss dreaming of a home.   In the office, the film is made. Without effort, these scenes play and develop.    Finally,  Intimate Strangers  boasts one of the most vibrant scenes in recent memory. Monsieur Faber dances exuberantly to a record of Wilson Picketts In the Midnight Hour. This sequence lasts only a few moments, but is as close to truly cinematic as anything Ive seen. Pure emotion, expressed by someone that youd never expect to express it in the way that they do. The scene is the mixture of surprise and expectation. Luchini brings an energy and enjoyment rarely seen in the movies.   What the rest of the film is about and what happens is best discovered by the audience; writing about it makes the joy it brings too mundane.  Intimate Strangers  is very good. It is a film that is at once complicated and incredibly simple.         \n",

      "         Ju-On (The Grudge ) (1 SK)    This is the type of film that will drive rational people out of their minds. Why? In the world of the film, apparently the most effective way to hide is to pull your bed covers over your head. When I was five that worked, well, that and my Mom sitting on the bed next to me, but as an adult I have grown past that phase and have moved on to finding some sort of weapon.  Characters in horror films are not that evolved. They still wander into stupid locations and announce their presence by some ridiculous method, but that is why audiences go to see them. People want to see them die. And they want to get scared.   Great horror films use intelligent people in situations that work when rationale will not. Think of  The Exorcist . What rational person could deal with that situation? Most horror films fall into the category just below this one, where not-so-smart characters find themselves in situations they could easily dislodge themselves from by running or going on vacation.   (If Laurie Strode had just bought a plane ticket and moved to Europe, Michael Myers would have had a hell of a time finding her. It is not like the security would have let him through customs. Imagine that interaction:   Passport Agent : Ok, Mr. Myers. Whats the purpose of your visit?  Michael Myers : (kicks ground with foot) Kill Laurie Strode.  Passport Agent : Guards!  Maybe include some banter about how he looks like a bleached William Shatner mask... Of course, all of these situations would end up with Michael killing people and eventually being deported, but Ms. Strode would be fine.)  The point of this meaningless diatribe is that the situations these characters find themselves in are as irrelevant as the conversations about what they should have done.    Ju-On  is a film on the verge of being very good, but it falls short in the third act. Instead of everything coming together, the answer seems either idiotic or incomprehensible, depending on your mood, but one way or another the audience leaves scratching their head trying to figure out what happened to the film they had been watching.  The film is a variation of the new wave of horror coming out of Japan, films like Hideo Nakatas  Ring  or the work of Takashi Miike ( Audition ).  Ju-On  steals from  Ring  in the same way Quentin Tarantino steals from everyone, right out there in the open so you can call them on it. Though, it is important to point out that they both steal for the improvement of their own films.   In  Ju-On , there is a sequence where a character looks through a security monitor and sees a ghostly shape moving towards the camera. For everyone who has seen Ring or the American remake, this scene might ring a bell. But the end to this scene in Ju-On is different enough to be original and more importantly, creepy.  The story involves a curse, or grudge, that a dead family places on a house. Anyone who become associated with the house either dies or becomes part of the curse. It is a sort of tag, youre it style of storytelling. The film jumps from story to story, through time and back again, to come to its conclusion. It is not a precise method, but it does not hamper the film in the obvious ways, that is to say, there are still some very good moments of terror, such as the lady who crawls and the boy in white face are both creepy. (Despite, or maybe because of, the bad make-up.)  As a horror film, it works well enough. If you let it tell its story, it will scare you. Or it will scare you long enough to see its American remake, which hits theaters this fall, directed by Takashi Shimizu, who did this version as well, and starring Sarah Michelle Gellar.       \n",

      "         Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  (1/2 SK)    The third installment of the Harry Potter series is arguably the best of the three, while simultaneously being the most incomplete. To be sure, the acting and cinematic craft of the film has reached a new high, but the story has suffered. It is the classic damned if you do, damned if you dont situation.  My view of the film has been tainted by the fact that I have read the books and know what has been omitted. I know and accept this flaw in my reasoning, but I also contest that the film still fails in certain other tangible places.  The best example is Gary Oldman as the madman Sirius Black. Why is his arrival in the film so belated? He is such an interesting character, a character that screams for more screen time than he is given. While always in the shadows, the director never makes Oldmans presence felt.   The film is misleading in this manner. It is not really about the Prisoner of Azkaban, but the adolescence of Potter and his friends. Which is fine, it just does not fully represent the intentions of the plot.   The slight of hand would be more successful if in fact Sirius Black surprised the audience with his appearance, instead of just materializing when and where he is suspected.  This is not to say that the film is bad. By all means, it is a good film and all of the surrounding puzzle pieces fit in seamlessly. It is easy to criticize a film for what it does not have. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban might have been better with a talking giraffe, but it does not have one and that is an unfair criticism. In the same way, the series has created such rich characters that the reduction of screen time might also be seen as a negative.   Alfonso Cuarn and his crew have done a wonderful job adapting a novel into a moving picture. Cuarn has crafted some wonderful performances out of the Daniel Radcliff and Emma Watson. (I would include Rupert Grint, but he has been good in all three.) Wonderful British actors like David Thewlis and Timothy Spall have rounded out the cast of characters nicely, but all of this does not solve the Oldman problem.  Why does it seem that Oldman is the ood man out? Most likely, it is because his character rests inside the largest of the plot holes. In the book, Professor Lupin(Thewlis) has been helping Black in his return to Hogwarts. Lupin has helped Black search the campus for his betrayer.   But in the movie there is no explanation for Blacks apparent ease in avoiding capture, or how he gets in and out of the castle. It is not that the books way of dealing with this problem is the best, but that it deals with it at all. It is easy to concede to a films logic when it is present, but hard when the audience has to figure it out themselves.  For goodness sake, the film title specifies what the film is about. How can there be any confusion on the hows and the whys of Sirius Blacks relation to the world that he embodies?  Maybe the fourth film will answer the questions that the third raises, but it that fair? The audience for these films is built in, so whether or not these questions are answered will become futile.        \n",

      "   Well I guess it's official, the ex gave our son until 09/15 to remove himself from the premises.  Actually he told him to either shape up or ship out and my son has elected to ship out.  So, he's 18, fresh out of high school, his only transportation is a bike, he has $1,000 in the bank and is looking to strike out on his own.  We are trying to get him to move up here but he doesn't want to leave his friends.  I don't have the heart to tell him that he won't have the same friends in another few years.  But he's 18 and the world is beckoning and there are lessons to be learned that only he can learn on his own.  My car is fixed, it's running great and I am so very happy to be able to drive myself to and from work everyday.  Not that I minded Grey dropping me off and picking me up but my time to and from work is a time of transition to either gear up for work or to wind down and I prefer to do that alone where I can control the music, the temperature of the a/c and what lane of traffic I'm in. LOL  I think that this is the very first time that I have not watched the Olympics at all!  I used to eagerly anticipate it but for some reason it doesn't hold any interest for me this year, not even the equestrian events.  Grey and I are still in our CSI kick and are currently watching the 2nd season.  Oh, I had choir practice last night for the first time.  Definitely some tough stuff to learn.  I think I will get better as time goes on.  It's not that I can't sing, it's reading the music, understanding the different symbols and words.  I was taught that stuff as a child taking piano lessons but that was over 30 years ago and I have forgotten most of it.  I need to remember what means to go faster, to go slower, to pause, to increase in volume, to be soft, etc.  I also need to remember which bar the sopranos sing or I'm going to end up accidentally being a soloist!

Nice thing about us, we may have a disagreement, but it doesn't take long before we are back to normal and being madly in love again.  Not that we ever stopped loving each other when we were arguing    I passed my CTP exam!  I didn't realize just how much stress I was under and how much pressure was on me until it was over and I felt like I was walking on air!  Now that's it's over, I look back and think 'What was the big deal, now I have letters to put after my name'  But I know that if I hadn't have passed it, I would have felt horrible.  Bonnie and Charley came and went without much consequence here.  Some rainy weather, some tornados, but nothing that was any more than what we normally get during the summer.  We were mostly concerned about friends and family in Polk County which got slammed pretty hard.  Fortunately, most of the people we have down there live on the west side of the county, the east side of the county is still trying to clean up and Jeb Bush was out there yesterday to survey the damage.  I have a few friends who are still without power and are struggling to get chainsaws to cut up trees that fell on their property but fortunately no one was injured.  My best friend and I are having some problems regarding trust issues and my 'interference' in her relationship with Grey.  My suggestion for anyone contemplating any kind of poly relationship?  Don't! LOL   Raven and I aren't intimate and Grey and her aren't intimate either anymore however her children regard him as their Dad and she still regards him as her Dominant.  Add me, best friend and also Dominant but not her Dominant but married to her Domminant and you get conflict LOL.  She wrote me a nice long letter yesterday outlining all of her issues.  It is going to take me a couple of days to think through the things she said and respond in a rational manner.  Tonight is my first night of official choir practice.  I guess we will be preparing for a concert that we have coming up next month and I'm sure we will soon be preparing for the Christmas programs.   I have had two bad dreams about my daughter Morgan the past week.  The first one, Grey woke me up because I was yelling and crying in my sleep.  In that one, someone came along on a motorcycle or motorscooter or something and abducted her.  Last night, she had been out playing and never came home.  I dreamt one long dream last night which I spent looking for her with a police officer.  I even woke up during the night and tried to change my thoughts so I wouldn't dream it anymore, but I kept dreaming.  Grey says that I'm having separation anxiety after having her all summer long which makes sense.  I just wish they would stop.  Just got off the phone with the ex.  He's about to kick my son out of the house because of his mouth and his attitude.   If he does, he will likely have to move up here with his mouth and his attitude and something is going to have to change.  We aren't anymore inclined to put up with it than his Dad and Renee are.  How do you get an 18 year old with a chip on his shoulder to change his attitude?  Not going to be doing much in the way of lifestyle stuff for the next couple of months.  Gator games are taking priority on Saturdays although we already have a conflict on labor day weekend as I was planning to take Grey to the season opener but he had promised Raven and the kids that they could come up that weekend.  Yet another family squabble to work out.    I need to find a slave that changes cat litter and likes to go to football games.  LOL  Wait, that's right, they don't have to like football, they just go with and keep running for cokes and pizza while I enjoy the game!  It's good to be the king. LOL  From what I understand Don and Michelle are going to Bermuda in September and won't be at Chambers anyway so not a big loss to miss that one anyway.  October is another story however, with David and Gem coming down from NYC, Lord Blakwolf and Tig's collaring at The Ranch, the Biketoberfest weekend at the ranch and a Cecil and Becca's wedding/collaring that same weekend.   October is definitely going to be party time.  Oh and let's not forget Florida/Georgia October 30, another kind of party  : )   At some point between now and then Grey will be having his surgery.  So the next couple of months promise to be very busy and then we get into the holiday season.  It will be 2005 before we know it!  Well I guess I should probably get back to work! LOL  It's nice to have a slow day every now and then.     \n",

      "       Every morning I take the same road to work. First, let me tell you that I grew up in a rural area - the Catskills in NY - and I do NOT like big cities, except, perhaps, to visit. I also love animals and birds. My husband and I are avid birders.  Anyway, now I live in a city. (My ex-husband moved me here.....nuff said) A city that used to be rural many years ago, and still has a few 'country' looking areas left. What do I do? Try to find them in my living and driving areas, and make sure I choose THOSE routes rather than heavily travelled thouroughfares.  So.....every day I take the same road to work - it's a little connecting 'back' road kind of thing, in an area that used to be all farms and horses and many acre homesteads. There are still some left, but they are disappearing rapidly.  On this little 2-mile-long road things are changing. There used to be a ranch style single story home raised up onto the second story (a building technique used in places that flood a lot, like in the Keys). It was on several acres of brushy land, full of palm and other types of trees. There were always two barking hound dogs that chased along the front fence, and there were Egyptian geese that perched on the roof of the house, along with other assorted ducks - even some peacocks. The front of the house boasted a front porch with chairs to sit and watch life go by, and couple of semi-beat up pick ups parked on the grass to the side. It was lovely. It had been there for at least 40 years - that's my guess. All kinds of birds and wild parrots frequented the trees there.  One morning a couple of weeks ago, I saw the bulldozers. The dogs and the pickups were gone. A sign had been planted out by the road 'Coming Soon!! Distinctive Estate Homes!!'  Crap. Another piece of the old, gentler times gone. I bet the problem was that the original owner didn't make much money, and couldn't make necessary improvements to the old house. But, since land prices here are going sky high - your house can be worth $10,000. more at the end of any given month - he was sitting on a gold mine - the ability to retire and live in a nice new house somewhere else. So he sold to the Evil AntiChrist Developers, tucked tail and ran. His neighbors across the street, still living on the same types of property and in older homes, are fingering their thin wallets, perhaps. Thinking, 'gotta get outta here'.  And so my little rural road, my little 2 mile long piece of 'country' is rapidly diminishing, falling to the developers and their dull, cookie cutter, blow-down-at-the-first-big-wind, $500,000. homes - and the idiots that buy them and, unfortunately, inhabit them.  And with the new owners, come the new ideals. No trees, except palms. Lawns must be manicured and bushes well trained and trimmed. No room for birds or wildlife to hide.  And you know what is the saddest thing? The black capped parakeets and the pair of Pileated woodpeckers that I know lived there in the past, depending on the dead palm trunks for home and nest - they'll move too. To be replaced by the usual grackles and pidgeons.  I need to move to Montana, except I'm scared of the snow.      \n",

      "       This past weekend, my husband and I went 'urban exploring'. If you google this phrase, you'll get tons of links to ..... you guessed it.....urban explorers - people, mostly young and spry, who investigate (read 'trespass' or 'break in') abandoned buildings in any given city on the planet. These are people after my own heart. I am a frustrated archeologist and explorer. I can think of nothing more fascinating than sneaking into an abandoned building and seeing what can be found.  We went to a site in the Everglades, off the Ingraham Highway (#9336) and turned off on a road called 'Aerojet'. On the left side is the nifty 'Everglades Youth Camp' - actually a juvenile prison surrounded by high barbed wire fencing. As you proceed about a 1/2 mile down the paved road, there are lots of trees on the right, and on the left about 300 feet off the road, are abandoned concrete buildings, some of which are 2 stories high. There are lots of buildings spread out over acres, and the road that leads off to the left, towards them, is blocked. There are 'no trespassing' signs EVERYWHERE, and of course, a piece of fencing is down (torn down) and easy access to the whole place is before us.  We did not go in.  We are not young.  We do not have a gun.  There was an empty white pickup parked where we stopped and no human(s) to be seen.  We do not want to go to jail. So we didn't go in. But we WANTED to REALLY REALLY REALLY bad. If we could just get a bunch of people to go with us, we would feel safer - except we would certainly be noticeable then......  We're going back.  Until we have the chutzpah to trespass.  When we got home, we did mucho internet research and found out that Aerojet Corp purchased some 35 acres at that spot in the 60's.....they experimented with solid rocket boosters, with the idea of shipping them via water to Cape Canaveral for the Space Race. In fact, a whole canal was created that runs all the way to the Bay and under Card Sound Road. When you are on Card Sound Road (I read this, but have not seen for myself), you come to this canal, there is a bridge that opens up - and the question arises, 'why is there a bridge like this on a small canal?' The answer is the Saturn V rockets that would have floated underneath, on their way to Aeroject in the Everglades.  The location never did well, they ran a few tests, never hired the employees they thought they would - and it all went down the drain.......Aerojet, who purchased the land for about $50.00 an acre, sold to the South Florida Water Mgmt. District for about $1.78 million - and the SFWMD is turning the area into a 'buffer' area between Homestead/Redlands agricultural runoff and the Everglades National Park, directly to the south of the Aeroject site. It is already a place for hunters during the season, and is listed alternately as 'Frog Pond' or 'Lucky Hammock'. Birders go there in the winter and many migratory species are reported there.  Well - that is our research....and there those buildings stand 'to this very day.' The End     \n",
